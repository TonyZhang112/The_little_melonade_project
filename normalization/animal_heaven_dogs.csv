Tainy,2 months,Female,"Retriever, Labrador/Mixed Breed (Medium)","Meet our Puerto Rican pups! These little ones survived thanks to the compassion of a local woman who wouldn't give up on them.

When their mama showed up and gave birth near the woman’s food stand, she kept a close eye on the pups. Mama eventually retreated into the brush to give birth to her last puppy, Tainy, but the woman didn’t know at the time if mama would return. With darkness approaching, the woman didn’t want to leave the puppies alone—so she took them in, keeping them beside her day and night. While she ran her food stand by day, the woman was a cab driver at night. And guess who came along? The woman lovingly bottle fed each of the puppies in between fares, making sure they received enough nutrition to continue growing big and strong.

Eventually, mama returned to the food stand with Tainy to reunite with the rest of her pups. The woman took the whole little family in to keep them safe, and we welcomed these survivors to NYC. Now, they’re ready to find homes!",https://new-s3.shelterluv.com/profile-pictures/7c817ade0fc60dc3362d238991c61b06/09ff2c302b950b83ad1bcea79d122999.jpg,https://animalhaven.org/adopt/adoption-interest-form?animal_s__of_interest=Tainy&hsLang=en,"9.1

Thankfully, she is now safe with us. 

When Roxana arrived at Animal Haven, she was nothing but sweet, offering small tail wags and hopeful glances. We took her straight to our partner vet for a full workup, where she was friendly and gentle with everyone she met. 

Roxana is not yet out of the woods, but thankfully, she is stable. She's on a special diet to help her safely gain weight. Our team is providing her with lots of enrichment and company to keep her fulfilled while she recuperates.

Despite her lack of spots, this spunky girl is in fact a Dalmatian! Nieve is just under 2 years old, and we suspect she may have been a bit undersocialized before arriving at Animal Haven. She’s been making great strides in our training and rehabilitation program, where she’s learning how to walk politely on leash and navigate the sights, smells, and sounds of our busy city. 

Nieve will do best with a somewhat experienced adopter who can continue reinforcing her basics. An active home would also benefit Nieve, who would make an excellent running, hiking, and adventure buddy. Nieve is learning how to meet other dogs politely, but enjoys making new human friends and can’t wait to show you her favorite tennis ball! Adopt Nieve!",https://new-s3.shelterluv.com/profile-pictures/2639fb8e0385530594fc4e44aa56aa71/95c547f1274327ed566ea125b7a62248.jpg,https://animalhaven.org/adopt/adoption-interest-form?animal_s__of_interest=Nieve&hsLang=en,"54.0

Gina,2 years,Female,Shepherd/Mix,"Meet Gina! This sweet shepherd mix was likely used for breeding—she was seen in a home with a male dog before being abandoned in a nearby parking lot, extremely skinny, anxious, and with signs of having recently given birth. A Good Samaritan found her and tried to return her to the suspected owners, but they refused to answer the door. 

When Gina arrived at Animal Haven, it quickly became clear that something was different about her: She would begin spinning in circles, sometimes snapping at the air in the process. Initially, we thought this might be a neurological problem and consulted with a specialist to conduct an MRI and spinal tap, but the results did not reveal any neurological or medical issues. We then consulted with a veterinary behaviorist, who suspects that Gina’s spinning episodes are caused primarily by environmental triggers. 

Gina now has a long-term plan to help reduce her stress, manage her environment, and provide her with enrichment and decompression time to hopefully reduce her spinning and air-snapping episodes, but this will be a journey. Her adopter will need to be willing to work with Gina and our trainers to manage her environment and continue her regimen. 

While Gina is definitely a project who will do best with an experienced adopter, we can say with certainty that she is a total sweetheart! She’s snuggly, playful, and responsive to treats and toys. Her episodes typically happen when she is loose in a space, whether her kennel or one of our training rooms, and she can be “snapped out” of them fairly easily. Animal Haven will of course provide ongoing support to help Gina transition and settle into her new home and life. Reach out to our team if you’re interested in meeting Gina and learning more about this darling pup!",https://new-s3.shelterluv.com/profile-pictures/3769766bd8d3387d55e1fa5021a304ba/64336cbfa454da95a6e75a797ee194d2.jpg,https://animalhaven.org/adopt/adoption-interest-form?animal_s__of_interest=Gina&hsLang=en,"40.7

She was involved in a court case, leaving her in limbo at a municipal shelter for around a year while the case worked its way through the courts. During that time, she became the shelter’s go-to pup for socialization and playdates with other dogs, given her social nature.

Mario,3 years,Male,"Terrier, American Staffordshire","Mario was found as a stray on the streets of NYC. This terrified boy was trembling when he was caught by police who brought him to a municipal shelter. It's hard to say what his life was before he was found, but he's clearly been through a lot. He was completely shut down when he first arrived at Animal Haven - he trembled in the corner and wouldn’t even take treats tossed near him. But our dedicated staff have been working with him every day to earn his trust and we’re so happy to report that their work has clearly paid off.

Mario has become fast friends with many of our staff and volunteers and has really come out of his shell, but he will need a patient and understanding family who’s willing to work at his pace to build his confidence and set him up for success. He is still a little bit nervous on walks if there is a lot of foot traffic, so he would likely do best in a quieter neighborhood. Mario has shown no aggression during his time with us, favoring avoidance if he’s ever uncomfortable in any situation. Overall, he is a gentle soul who just needs a little extra time to settle in to a new space.

He’s a big guy, but tries to be small whenever he can. We know this sweet boy has a big heart to match and will make an amazing companion for someone willing to put in a little time for him. Interested in Mario? We encourage you to submit an inquiry through his profile prior to visiting him to make sure Mario’s best friends can make his introductions.

Harmony,4 years,Female,"Retriever, Black Labrador/Mixed Breed (Medium)","Harmony is so sweet, it’s hard to believe how much she’s endured. Originally from an overcrowded southern shelter, Harmony came to Animal Haven with her 5 puppies. She was heartworm positive, with one of the heaviest heartworm burdens we’ve ever seen. Her treatment has stretched over months, during which time she’s had to remain as calm as possible. 

Even worse, when our veterinary team took x-rays of Harmony’s heart, they found her neck and chest to be riddled with BB pellets. Someone had shot at this sweet, gentle mama. 

That's all behind her now, and we're now rewriting Harmony’s story—helping her heal and ultimately find the loving home she so deserves.

Douglas,5 years,Male,Terrier/Mix,"Poor Douglas was found on the side of a road in Antigua, dragging his hind legs. Although his rescuers initially thought he had been hit by a car, upon further inspection his injuries were actually fairly old. They believe that he was likely attacked by other dogs on the island, leaving him with partial paralysis in his hindquarters.

Thanks to the amazing Dogs and Cats of Antigua, Douglas has made his way up to Animal Haven where his new life begins. We are so thankful to have the opportunity to give this sweet boy the chance at life he otherwise would not have had.

Right now we are still learning more about Douglas's current condition and we don't have a lot of answers just yet. We are sending him to our partner vets for spinal x-rays and a neurological consultation to get a better idea of the extent of his paralysis. Once we have more information, we'll be able to determine if he's a candidate for corrective surgery or wheelchair! We'll keep you all updated along his journey but he is available for adoption right now! Animal Haven will of course be covering the costs of his diagnostics and treatments and we're hopeful Douglas will charm his way into someone's heart soon.

In addition to his paralysis, Douglas is also suffering from heartworm, ehrlichia, a urinary tract infection, and open lesions on his legs - we know, he's got a LOT going on.

Sweet Cherie is looking for a family and she knows that you're thinking, ""I'm gonna make-a you mineee!""  She's a young and active staffie mix looking to be your one and only pup. She's super affectionate, big on hugs, and absolutely loves bringing her toys with her everywhere she goes.

A good Samaritan saw this poor girl being abandoned and immediately scooped her up out of harm's way. She's now safe and sound at Animal Haven and waiting for another chance to love again. 

Cherie has been in a few fosters during her time at Animal Haven and has done amazing on all of her outings away from the shelter.

Here are some notes from her last foster: 
Cherie is a sweet and well-behaved girl in a home, especially once she has a few days to settle into a new routine - she was accident free in just a few days! She's respectful of human belongings, both when you're home and when you're not.  She's affectionate, cuddly, and loves being right by your side whenever you're home! Cherie is a young and active girl who loves to play, but settles in her bed or on the couch when you leave and will wait for you to get home. 

Cherie gets incredibly excited for walks - she's ready to go whenever! Her toys are great to keep her focused and helps keep her energy directed where it needs to be. She has come a long way since she's been with us, but is still working on her leash manners. She doesn't like to say hi to other dogs, but as long as they don't bark at her, she's been learning to mind her own business.

She is a sweet and active companion and also a good jogging partner! She'll appreciate it as she has lots of energy! Cherie will likely never be a dog park kind of dog, although she has played with some other dogs in the past, she can be a lot for other dogs if they can't match her energy.

Cherie is hoping she'll be able to find a new family of her very own and we know there's someone out there looking for an active, smart-cookie like her!

Monte,7 years,Male,"Retriever, Yellow Labrador/Mix","Monte lives with a condition called Megaesophagus. This condition varies in severity on a case by case basis with all dogs and we look to our vets directly on recommendations for his care. Essentially, Monte's esophagus is enlarged and doesn't function correctly to help keep his food down. Monte must sit in a special chair that keeps him upright in order to prevent him from regurgitating his food and he needs to stay upright after feedings for 10-15 minutes to ensure the food safely reaches his stomach. Monte has his own custom ""Bailey Chair"" and uses it like an absolute pro - he hops right into it when it's meal time! His chair will come with him when he's adopted!

Monte is a gleeful, playful dog who otherwise lives a normal life. He LOVES toys and enjoys his ""party time"" in our training room where he runs out his zoomies. Although his condition prevents us from using treats to train, he's highly toy motivated and has been picking up basics like a pro! We've also been utilizing special treats just for dogs with his condition which he loves! Potential adopters will need to be aware that Monte is on a special diet for his condition and currently has 3 meal times a day. If he accidentally ingests anything between those mealtimes, he will need to sit in his chair. He's a big boy that will need consistent, unique training and supervision while he works on his impulse control!

Unfortunately, Monte has spent the majority of his life in a shelter environment during the pandemic, Monte is a little behind in his socialization. He can be unsure about meeting new people and will bark at things he is apprehensive about. He is great with those who he has been properly introduced to though and good introductions will be key! Monte would likely do best in a quieter neighborhood out of Manhattan, away from any enticing sidewalk snacks he shouldn't get into and scary skateboarders.

Stevie,8 months,Female,"Terrier, American Staffordshire","Stevie’s backstory is a bit of a mystery to us, but what we do know is heartbreaking. She was found in a box along with two other puppies, one of which had sadly passed away. She ended up with a family who was ultimately not able to care for her, and made her way to Animal Haven for a third chance.

Stevie is a social gal who loves human attention and has been interested in the dogs she’s met at the shelter so far. She has exuberant puppy energy and is understandably a bit anxious, given everything she’s gone through. With stability, patience, and lots of love, we think Stevie will blossom into a much more confident dog and a loving companion!
