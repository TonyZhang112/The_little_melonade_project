ZZ Bella and Roscoe-Courtesy Listing,3 Years,Female,Labrador Retriever,"A little About ZZ Bella and Roscoe-Courtesy Listing...
We would love these two dogs to find a forever home together, but it is not absolutely necessary.
Bella and Roscoe are a beautiful brother–sister duo who have grown up together and share a truly special bond. They’re both incredibly sweet, affectionate dogs who want nothing more than a safe, loving home where they can be part of the family. Both pups had a full vet check-up and updated vaccines on 11/18/25 They’re healthy, up-to-date, and have no medical issues. They are gentle, friendly, and have never shown any aggression  toward people. They both did a 16 hour road trip without any complications, no barking, no whining, and no climbing.
Bella is a total sweetheart with a huge heart and even bigger personality. She loves pets, neck scratches, and belly rubs — and she’ll happily melt right into you for attention. She has a playful, energetic side outdoors, but she settles nicely once inside and loves relaxing with her humans. Bella can get excited and may jump up to greet you, but it’s all love and enthusiasm. She enjoys fetch, chew toys, and exploring new scents. She’s great with other dogs — always eager to say hello — and if another dog gets too pushy, she’ll simply bark to communicate. She’s been doing wonderfully on a leash. She gets curious and may stop to sniff, but listens well when you encourage her to keep moving. She has not had any accidents inside the house and has been responding very well to a walking routine. An angel in the car. 

Roscoe is our gentle giant — a big, lovable teddy bear who just wants someone to be near. He’s more low-key than Bella but still enjoys playtime, cuddles, and belly rubs (his absolute favorite). He’s curious about other dogs and may pause to look, but he doesn’t pull. If another dog becomes aggressive, he’ll give a bark, but overall he’s calm and easygoing. Because of his size and his early inexperience with walks, he’s currently using a prong collar for guidance — and he has made huge progress. Initially Roscoe was hesitant to get moving, but now, with a gentle correction, he happily follows along and often walks right at your side. If pulled too firmly, he may flop over for attention instead — he’s truly a softie at heart. He's an angel in the car.

ZZ Finn-Courtesy Listing,2 Years,Male,German Shepherd,"A little About ZZ Finn-Courtesy Listing...
Meet Finn.  He became homeless when his owner recently passed away. Finn is an awesome 2yr old German Shepherd. True to his breed, he is smart and loyal. He was well bred and has great structure and hips.  He responds well to ALL spoken commands, is housebroken, and takes food gently. He is excellent in the house  and quietly follows you around.  Finn is neutered, up to date on vaccines, walks very well on the leash and does 'his business quickly once outside. Finn  prefers spending time with his person and would do best with a quiet home with lots of love. Finn enjoys bird watching but is definitely a squirrel chaser. Finn would benefit from a place to run (a large fenced yard would be great) and an active lifestyle, although he is capable of being a couch potato as well. He is young and deserves a forever home to call his own.  This young handsome boy needs a forever home asap, as his foster family will be traveling at the end of October!  If interested please contact 646-207-6966 or ldellatte@hotmail.com",https://ny-petrescue.org/files/eShop/finn155.jpg,https://www.cognitoforms.com/PetRescue2/PetRescueDogApplication,55 lbs,Adult size: Medium (35-55 lbs),https://ny-petrescue.org//Adopt-Dogs/details/2981/ZZ-Finn-Courtesy-Listing

THREE-LEGGED FLOWER WILL BLOOM WITH YOUR ADOPTION  Meet Flower, a sweet and courageous three-legged dog seeking a forever home.

Basic training and housebreaking is complete, and additional training will be paid for. Flower is most likely full size, and ever so ready to provide affection and loyalty.

Sly is a spunky, 3-year-old Jack Russell/Rat Terrier mix is ready to steal your heart—and maybe your tennis ball! Sly is every bit the classic terrier: smart, energetic, and totally toy-obsessed. Balls, squeakers, stuffies—you name it, he’s all in. He’s housebroken, loves leash walks, loves car rides (a true gentleman on the road), and forms a deep bond with his person. Once he picks you, he’s your loyal shadow, ready to join you on every daily errand or adventure. Sly would thrive in a home where someone is around most of the time and happy to include him in their day-to-day routine. He’s not the kind of dog who likes to be left behind—he’s a “ride or die” kind of pup. While he can learn to coexist with most dogs given proper introduction, Sly definitely prefers to be the king of his castle. He’d be happiest as your one and only.  No cats for sly.
