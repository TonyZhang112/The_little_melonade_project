Amped,Adult,Male,Mixed Breed,"Say hi to Amped! Loyal, sweet, and energetic pup. When we first picked him up, he walked right up to us with his tail wagging ready to go home. He went straight into the back seat of the car and took a quiet nap on his hour drive to his temporary home. He warmed up to our family very quickly and likes to check in on us when we go into separate rooms to make sure everything is okay. He's becoming a pro at being in his crate when we are not home and when he uses it to sleep some nights he gives no fuss and quietly sleeps. He is the best pup at using the bathroom outside and has had zero accidents in the house! He is learning to walk slowly and steady on his leash while he takes in all the new sites and scents. Although he is very playful he is equally a snuggler/napper. With some training and lots of love, I guarantee that Amped (aka Ranger) will be the best companion.

Doris,Puppy,Female,Chihuahua/Corgi,"Doris - 1 year, 18lbs, Corgi/Beagle Mix, Spayed This dog is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60 walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably! Adults usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. A consistent walking route and schedule plus finding spots with grass or dirt can help. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some like to wrestle with every passing pup, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Not sure yet! Some breed mixes that are generally NOT great matches for homes with cats include large hounds, huskies, and shepherds. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico ; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

Wilson,Senior,Male,American Bulldog/American Staffordshire Terrier,"Name: Wilson Age: 9 years old Weight: 75 lbs Breed: American bulldog Mix ⸻ Senior gentleman Wilson has had an unpredictable home for most of his life. He ended up in the shelter a few times because his owner could not take care of him, but he was always eventually reclaimed. When his owner was evicted in September, Wilson and his feline sibling were left behind, trapped in their apartment. Thankfully they were rescued, but for Wilson it was the start of a difficult few months. Back in the city shelter once again, Wilson slowly started to shut down, becoming more anxious everyday, eventually refusing to go on walks, interact with staff and barely eating. In November, Wilson was moved to the euthanasia list and his time was running out. Thankfully, at the last minute a kind hearted foster came forward and agreed to take in this gentle giant so we were able to welcome him to our rescue. Wilson was a little nervous at all the changes, but after a few days of love and attention in a home with 2 cats and a small dog, Wilson relaxed and showed us what an amazing addition to any family he would. Wilson is a happy, playful guy who adores spending time with his people. He doesn’t need to sleep in the bed with you but he would love to curl up in a dog bed right beside you at night. He doesn’t need to be entertained when you want a quiet evening but he would love to snuggle on the couch with you. He doesn’t need you to take him hiking every weekend but he would love a game of fetch at the park. Wilson is cat, dog and kid friendly, but he is a big boy who will need a playdate with dogs and kids before deciding if he is the right match for you. Wilson had some issues with his teeth when he first came to us but has had a full dental and is now in much better shape. He does have some teeth missing and would do well with softer food and treats.

Tyler loves to spend time outside and would be delighted to have access to a garden for sunbathing.

Jimmy,Adult,Male,Boxer/American Bulldog,"“Meet King James, a charming and affectionate five-year-old pup who’s truly as majestic as his name suggests. This sweet, handsome boy was on the list to be euthanized and we were fortunate enough to save him minutes before it was too late . Surrendered through no fault of his own, King Jimmy was deeply loved by his previous family, who made the difficult decision to rehome him after moving in to care for elderly parents. This loyal boy has known nothing but love and kindness and is now hoping to find his next forever home—one where he can once again be someone’s best friend, hiking buddy, and devoted shadow. King aka Jimmy is the perfect blend of playful and chill. He's housebroken, crate trained, and knows all his basic commands—including “sit,” “stay,” “wait,” and “leave it.” He’s got great leash manners, walking at a calm, easy pace with only the occasional tug when something especially exciting (like a stray cat!) crosses his path. He’s easily redirected with a gentle voice or treat and always eager to please. Speaking of treats, he loves them :) Jimmy’s previous owner stated that he was attacked by two dogs before coming into the shelter (see his adorably wonky ear). He’s been getting along great with the dogs he’s met in foster, but if you have another dog a meet and greet is required to make sure it’s a good match.

Rocky,,Male,Terriers (Medium),"Meet Rocky, a resilient and affectionate 4.5-year-old pup looking for a fresh start after a tough few months of transitions. Originally rehomed by his first owner, Rocky was then surrendered by his second family after just three months, through no fault of his own. Despite the instability in his life, Rocky remains a sweet, wiggly boy who greets everyone with a wagging tail and a heart full of love. Rocky is the definition of a social butterfly—he's incredibly people-friendly, happily nuzzling into volunteers and seeking out affection wherever he goes. He allows all-over handling, even during medical care, and has proven himself to be both gentle and trusting as he heals from some minor wounds. Though he can be a little snatchy with treats, he's food-motivated and easy to redirect. On walks, Rocky pulls only slightly and enjoys sniffing and exploring. He loves being outside and is eager to get out of his kennel, though he sometimes needs a little coaxing to go back in. In playgroups, Rocky has shown some curiosity about other dogs but tends to be more of an observer, keeping his distance and sniffing around the yard rather than engaging in direct play. He’s also lived with cats in his previous home and reportedly got along well with them. Whether you’re looking for a loyal companion to share quiet walks, cuddle sessions, or just some relaxed company, Rocky could be your guy.

Brandi,Adult,Female,Labrador Retriever/American Staffordshire Terrier,"Pretty girl Brandy, 50 lbs, 2-5 years old is a total lover and she is happiest just to be in your company. She has a lot of puppy energy and is looking for a family interested in playing, training and spending lots of time with her. She loves people and greets everyone with her whole body happy wiggle. Before coming to our rescue, Brandi spent 5 months at the city shelter after being found as a stray. Brandi adjusted well in her foster home, she is house broken and in good health apart from some seasonal allergies. Brandi does sometimes get nervous around loud, unexpected noises and would be happier living in a quieter home. She has done well meeting other dogs and cats but since her previous living situation is unknown to us, she will need to meet any other pets in your home. She has been great with all the people she has met but might be too playful for very small children. If you think you can give Brandi all the love she deserves and would like to meet her, please go to Petstablished.com or follow the link below to complete an application to adopt.

Charlie,Young,Male,Pointer/Labrador Retriever,"Charlie - 10 months & 50lbs (as of 8/12/25) Pointer Mix Neutered Expected to be about 50lbs Full Grown Our Team Says: Charlie needs a home in the burbs. He REALLY loves other dogs and would do really well in a home with another pup :) This puppy is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Thier Foster Parent Says: ""Charlie is an incredibly sweet, loving, funny guy. He loves to play with toys and other dogs, and, like most young dogs his age, likes to pass out after he's exhausted himself from playtime. He also loves to snuggle when he's tired, resting his head on your shoulder while he nestles. He is VERY scared of loud or new noises so he does need help shifting energy when he gets startled like that. Sometimes he barks and does a low-level growl when he hears those unfamiliar noises but he is never aggressive towards others. The only time he really barks is if someone is approaching the house to alert us but then quickly goes to hide if someone new comes inside. He can get a little scared and hide but, as he gets more and more acclimated, he comes out to explore his surroundings. It's very important to instill in him that he is safe and cared for at all times. Once he has decided you are a safe person, he will be your shadow! He's very playful and likes to jump up and sometimes will accidentally scratch but it's never on purpose-he just loves to have fun! He gets up around 7:00 am to go outside and have breakfast and then sometimes will even go back to sleep. Then he likes to play with other dogs (we have 2 others in the house) before taking a nap. We go for walks with Charlie to improve his leash etiquette-he's VERY eager to walk but is still learning how to walk better on the leash! Then we'll have dinner around 6:00 pm with him, he'll do some more romping, and he'll go to bed with us. He is very good about bedtime routine. Once the lights are off he goes to sleep and loves to cuddle up at the end of the bed. Overall, Charlie has been a real joy to have and to take care of. Anyone would be lucky to have him!"" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Cuddle Bug Level-high Comfy with strangers?- Fine with meeting new people but not particularly interested, kind of shy in busy social situations like a gathering or a packed day in the park. Once he is inside he will shower them with kisses. He just needs to be in his safe space. Good with Children? (ALWAYS requires supervision)- Yes for 12 and up -- may be a little energetic or a little skittish, best with older children that can be extra gentle or that are big enough not to get accidentally knocked down Good with Other Dogs?- Yes -- Good with all other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines Mouthy Behavior?- Is either still in the puppy stage or was never trained to not be mouthy. Wants to put everything in their mouth. Tries to chew on your hands when playing or needs attention, grabs the leash with its mouth, loves to gnaw on your personal belongings. He is easily corrected with a toy. Leash Manners?- Getting the Hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in its life but he is figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. Okay in the city? Sort of -- Spooked easily by loud noises and bustling areas but walks pretty well and probably just needs more time to adjust (may be a puppy or a brand new rescue) Jumping on People to Say Hi?- Medium – Jumps up only on people the dog knows when really excited. Stops with correction. Separation Anxiety? -Low – Completely fine being left home alone. Doesn’t cry or do anything shitty when you leave the apartment or house. Crate training? -Yep/mostly – Seems comfortable in the crate, may whine a little at first but settles pretty quickly. We use the crate when we leave the pup alone and/or at night Medical status: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee or St. Thomas. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

Steve,Young,Male,Terriers (Small)/Beagle,"Steve - 1 year, 25lbs, BeagleTerrier Mix, Neutered - low rider :) This dog is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Their Foster Parent Says: "" Steve loves people and dogs and chasing after squirrels and birds. Every time we pass a person or a dog, he is always wagging his tail and pulling his leash to greet them. As soon as someone gives him affection, he literally slides down and rolls over on his back for belly rubs. He is such a trusting and sweet dog. In the morning, he waits patiently for me in the bathroom while I get ready and will sit or lay down on my bath mat (since I have towels everywhere on the floor to protect my white carpets, he thinks any towel is for him) then we go for a 45 minute walk, come home and he eats his breakfast, depending on how tired he is from his walk, he will typically play on his own for an hour before taking a 4 hour nap. We then go for a potty break, play a little more and then another 45 minute walk in the evening followed by dinner, more play time and a final night potty. He is definitely teething right now and is a little mouthy which is understandable for a pup his age. He loves playing fetch, gnawing on his toys and is very food motivated. As a typical lab, he scarfs down his food in 5 minutes even with a slow feeder. He needs leash training as he pulls very hard during our walks when he sees a bird, squirrel or dog which is often as you can imagine in NYC. He is a little afraid of bikes, buses and leaf blowers and will pull the leash to move away from them and gets down low. However he is pretty tolerable of the city life and will adjust quickly. He’s very comfortable in elevators, with stairs and riding the subway which is impressive coming from South Carolina. The best part about this pup, is he practically came potty trained and crate trained and has had no accidents thus far! The best pup of the 7 I’ve fostered thus far."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60-90 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) City pup Seems unfazed by the sights and sounds, may as well have been born here. POTTY TRAINING Yes – Few or no accidents COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS Social butterfly – Wants to be friends with everyone who walks by, loves anyone who will stop to say hello. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Maybe for age 12 and up – Is either big and energetic (okay with kids big enough not to get knocked down) or a little skittish (could be comfortable with older children that can be extra gentle) SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Yes – Good with most other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc. Not sure – Wants to chase squirrels and birds so may not be a good match for a home with cats, rabbits, etc. MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Needs training – Is either still in the puppy stage or was never trained. Tries to put their mouth on your hands when playing or needs attention, grabs leash, chews on your personal belongings SEPARATION ANXIETY ( Adjusting – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone otherwise. LEASH MANNERS WTF is a leash – Pulls hard. Zig zags like crazy. Has no idea how to walk on a leash or doesn’t have outside privileges yet (too young) CUDDLE BUG LEVEL Medium – Likes to snuggle when he's in the mood but often stays in his own bed JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Needs training – Very excited to greet everyone and has no idea how to do so politely. Jumps up on most strangers or other dogs that go by. In puppy phase or wasn’t trained as a young adult. CRATE TRAINING Yep/mostly – Seems comfortable in the crate, may whine a little at first but settles pretty quickly. We use the crate when we leave the pup alone and/or at night. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico ; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico.

Whitney ,Puppy,Female,Bulldog/Mixed Breed,"**Meet Whitney: The Sweet and Gentle Soul** Introducing Whitney, the sweet and delicate sister of Wilbur and Wesley, who is ready to find her forever home! With her stunning blue eyes that shine with warmth and a gentle spirit, Whitney is a special pup who brings a touch of grace wherever she goes. Expected to grow to around 40 pounds, she is the perfect medium-sized companion for a loving family. Whitney’s journey began alongside her brothers, born to their feral mother, Ferraro. After facing the uncertainty of life in a South Carolina shelter, she was rescued along with her siblings just before a tragic fate could befall them. Though she may be a bit nervous in new situations, Whitney’s sweet nature allows her to warm up quickly to those who show her kindness and patience. Whitney’s personality truly shines when she is around her brothers, who help bring out her playful side and encourage her to explore her surroundings. We believe that Whitney would thrive best in a home with another dog, as having a furry companion to guide her would help her build confidence and trust in her humans. This affectionate girl loves to snuggle and relax, and she hopes to find a family that will appreciate her gentle spirit and provide her with the love and support she needs to flourish.

Princess,,Female,Pit Bull Terrier,"💗 Meet Princess – A Heart Too Big for the Pain She’s Known 💗 Princess’s story is one that truly touches the soul. This beautiful 6-month-old Pitbull mix was rescued back in August by a kind man who adored her deeply. He found her when she needed someone most — scared, unwanted, and alone — and he gave her safety, love, and a name fit for her sweet spirit: Princess. Tragically, her rescuer passed away not long after saving her. 💔 Through heartbreak and loss, one thing remained clear — Princess meant the world to him, and he wanted her to have a happy life. After his passing, a compassionate neighbor stepped in to make sure Princess wouldn’t end up back on the streets.

Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably!

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Our Team Says: ""Lissa is a very easy, chill and well behaved dog to have around. A perfect buddy. She would do best in a calm part of the city - BK, Queens or the calm areas near Central Park. She'd be beyond thrilled to live in the burbs. She's very trusting of women but takes some time to warm up to men, so they need to be extra gentle and patient with her."" Thier Foster Parent Says: "" Lissa is such a sweet girl. She loves attention - pets, belly rubs, even just talking to her. She loves to play fetch in the house with her stuffed toys and especially the tennis ball. She likes to play bite but is super gentle and listens when told to be nice or to stop. She knows sit, down, paw, other paw, and two paws (two paws meet two hands) - loves treats so can only do so many of those tricks before she gets too excited. Lissa loves to be outside and sniff but can be wary of noisier streets. Garbage trucks and mopeds/motorcycles seem to bother her the most. I think she would love a yard, and/or a quiet neighborhood to get longer walks in or near a park. If we go earlier in the morning when it is quiet, she walks very well. Easy to handle on the leash, sometimes just needs a little extra encouragement to keep walking if she gets spooked. Completely potty trained. We go out in the morning before breakfast, 1-2 times during the day, and once more before bedtime. Even though she doesn't walk too much, she's still pretty chill in the apartment. She'll sleep, seek out attention throughout the day to play for a bit and get out some energy, but ultimately hangs on the couch and just likes to be near someone. Loves attention but is just fine left alone - always greets you like you've been gone for ages and it is the sweetest welcome home. I adore her! She is very easy to take care of and is such a lover. Genuinely surprised someone hasn't adopted her yet!"" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: This dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day.

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: FLEXIBLE: We predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale with regard to exercise and mental stimulation requirements, but seniors tend to need a lot of help and understanding when it comes to lifestyle and veterinary issues. Seniors usually need quiet, calm environments and routines and do not do well with a lot of bustle, change, and rambunctious movement (kids and young playful dogs, for instance). This dog’s adopter will need to be prepared for senior health challenges, which usually come with expensive veterinary bills and time in vet offices. Senior care can also take an emotional toll on their humans. Adopting a mature pup is a wonderful thing to do, but it can also be difficult. Energy level LOWER: Pretty chill indoors and won’t demand endless amounts of stimulation and exercise but still needs a few short walks a day (10-30 min each) for potty breaks and to stretch their legs MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60-90 minute walk in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs socializing opportunities outside the home and a little mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice or chew items. Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most seniors do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably! Seniors usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. Seniors tend to need potty breaks more often than younger dogs though, and they can lose their ability to fully control their potty habits as they continue to age, so willingness to be flexible with cleanup and wee pads if necessary is important. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some enjoy the company of other calm dogs, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Probably. Seniors are usually mellow enough that they are able to coexist well with cats. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake. Adopters will need to be ready for senior care – at a minimum, that will be annual checkups including senior bloodwork and a dental post adoption (most senior rescues need one).

Pongo,Puppy,Male,Spaniels (Medium)/Poodle (Standard),"Pongo - 6 months & 35lbs (as of 10/21), Poodle Mix, Neutered Estimated full grown size around 50lbs This puppy is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Our Team Says: Pongo does best in the calmer parts of the city - BK, Queens, etc. Would love a burbs home. Thier Foster Parent Says: “Perfect Pongo” is our nickname for this goofy and cuddly guy. He’s an absolute love bug and can’t get enough of cuddles, especially in the morning when he’s lazy and wants to sleep in. We’ve been working on crate training and he has no aversion to the crate—he’d prefer to sit with you on the couch, but on occasion he has put himself to bed in the crate. He now knows how to “sit” and “come”, both of which are super helpful in walks when the city can become a little overstimulating for this Southern Gentleman. On walks he’s getting better on the leash, although he does love trash bags, probably a survival tactic from his previous days. He’s truly the nicest and kindest dog, with a heart of gold. He’s also incredibly enthusiastic, which can be both good and bad on walks. He loves to play with other dogs, sometimes playing for him is using his big paws to bat at another pup. He can be skittish around loud noises and big trucks. His potty training is going well! He does prefer to pee inside on a puppy pad, but he hasn’t had an accident off the puppy pad since his first day. He is a puppy so he might try to put his mouth around your finger, but he never closes on it. He’s got a soft mouth and the best heart."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) TOLERANCE TO CITY Adjusting to the city – Spooked easily by loud noises and bustling areas but walks pretty well in quiet areas and probably just needs more time to adjust (may be a puppy or a brand new rescue). Would prefer a home in a calmer part of the city or the suburbs. POTTY TRAINING Sort of — On the way and learning! May be using wee pads (is a puppy or a brand new rescue) COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS Social butterfly – Wants to be friends with everyone who walks by, loves anyone who will stop to say hello. (But also a little shy some days) BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Yes for most ages – very confident, gentle, low energy, tolerant, not mouthy (Can get scared when kids are erratic or aggressively patting his head) SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Yes – Good with most other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc.) Not sure – Wants to chase squirrels and birds so may not be a good match for a home with cats, rabbits, etc. MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Needs training – Is either still in the puppy stage or was never trained. Tries to put their mouth on your hands when playing or needs attention, grabs leash, chews on your personal belongings SEPARATION ANXIETY Adjusting – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone otherwise. LEASH MANNERS WTF is a leash – Pulls hard. Zig zags like crazy. Has no idea how to walk on a leash or doesn’t have outside privileges yet (too young) CUDDLE BUG LEVEL High – Wants to be in your lap pretty much all the time JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Listens to correction – Only jumps on people they know when really excited, stops with correction. CRATE TRAINING Yep/mostly – Seems comfortable in the crate, may whine a little at first but settles pretty quickly. We use the crate when we leave the pup alone and/or at night. MEDICAL STATUS: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon HOW DID THIS DOG END UP WITH US?

Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) POTTY TRAINED? Working on this skill. Puppies under 12 weeks old are often on track with their wee pad skills, but they’re too young to walk outside in public NYC areas yet because they haven’t finished their puppy vaccine series. Puppies older than 12 weeks are usually learning to do their business outside. Potty training takes a lot of patience, consistency, and clean up. SOCIAL WITH DOGS? Yes. Some puppies are shy, others are bold, but all have the potential to be taught healthy socializing skills. It’s a huge part of raising a puppy and must be done carefully. How they interact with other dogs depends largely on how their humans help them learn to. SOCIAL WITH CHILDREN? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) Yes… but most puppies are not a great match for a home with kids under age 8 because they go through intense mouthy play and rambunctious phases and often accidentally hurt young kids while playing. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. SOCIAL WITH CATS? Yes. Almost all puppies have the potential to be friends with a cat. It’s on the adopter to know their cat’s temperament and preferences and to teach their puppy respectful manners. MOUTHY PLAY: High! All puppies go through phases where they chew your stuff and grab your hands, arms, feet… puppies naturally explore the world, play, and test boundaries with their mouths. (It also happens when they’re teething.) Their teeth are super sharp though, so it can be a very painful phase for humans and other animals in the home. Proper training, outlets, and socialization are key. SEPARATION ANXIETY MEDIUM: Most puppies have some level of separation anxiety as they learn to self soothe. Often they cry the first 10+ minutes when they are left home alone or in a crate. Consistent training and alone time is crucial. LEASH MANNERS: None. :) Will need to learn this skill. CRATE TRAINED: Nope. None of our new puppies have been formally trained, but many of our foster parents/adopters choose to crate train. It can be a great way to keep puppies safe and teach them independence. MEDICAL STATUS: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon HOW DID THIS DOG END UP WITH US? Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

Lio,Senior,Male,Shih Tzu/Poodle (Miniature),"Lio - 10 years, 14lbs, Shi-poo, Neutered This senior angel is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Our Team Says: ""Lio has missing fur on the bottom half of his body due to living in neglect for a long time. He was rescued with a few other dogs thier hair grew back but his has not and we're not sure if it will - he's seen a vet - good bloodkwork for a senior. Lio also needs a home with another dog - he has seperation anxiety and another dog helps him a ton."" Thier Foster Parent Says: "" Lio has the sweetest, warmest personality and is always eager to please. He loves toys and can happily entertain himself, but he lights up when you join in on the fun. A true cuddle bug, he adores napping nearby and snuggling close. He’s still learning to go potty outside — we’ve been practicing every day by going on walks and letting him explore where other dogs have gone, but he hasn’t quite made the connection yet. He does use pee pads indoors and we’re continuing to work on it with patience and routine. On walks, I’ve already noticed steady improvement with his leash skills — he’s becoming more confident, curious, and comfortable with each outing. He’s been wonderful with other dogs, greeting them gently and respectfully, and while he’s a little shy in busier settings, he warms to people with a little bit of time. Despite being a senior, Lio has great energy — he can match your pace, whether you’re on a Zoom call needing a calm companion or ready for playtime. He's working hard on being home alone - his ideal home has another dog in it - he came from a hoarding situation. Occasionally, he’ll nudge a toy your way, just to see if you’re up for a little play or some extra pet."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: FLEXIBLE: We predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale with regard to exercise and mental stimulation requirements, but seniors tend to need a lot of help and understanding when it comes to lifestyle and veterinary issues. Seniors usually need quiet, calm environments and routines and do not do well with a lot of bustle, change, and rambunctious movement (kids and young playful dogs, for instance). This dog’s adopter will need to be prepared for senior health challenges, which usually come with expensive veterinary bills and time in vet offices. Senior care can also take an emotional toll on their humans. Adopting a mature pup is a wonderful thing to do, but it can also be difficult. TOLERANCE TO CITY City pup – Seems unfazed by the sights and sounds, may as well have been born here. POTTY TRAINING Sort of — On the way and learning! May be using wee pads (is a puppy or a brand new rescue) COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS In between bean – Fine with meeting new people but not particularly interested, kind of shy in busy social situations like a gathering or a packed day in the park. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Yes for most ages – very confident, gentle, low energy, tolerant, not mouthy SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Yes – Good with most other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc.) Not sure – Wants to chase squirrels and birds so may not be a good match for a home with cats, rabbits, etc. Have not really seen him around other animals besides dogs. Does not chase squirrels so far. MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Working on it – Is respectful of hands, feet, etc. but likes to chew on things they’re not supposed to like shoes, furniture, etc. Want to note that this is very minimal and he will stop if you just ask him to. SEPARATION ANXIETY (Please leave your foster dog home alone every day for at least 20 minutes.) Adjusting – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone otherwise. Seems to adjust being left alone a little better out of a crate than in a crate. Slightly anxious. LEASH MANNERS Getting the hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in their life but figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. CUDDLE BUG LEVEL High – Wants to be in your lap pretty much all the time JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Listens to correction – Only jumps on people they know when really excited, stops with correction. CRATE TRAINING Working on it – We set one up and leave the door open but rarely close it because the dog freaks out Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake. Adopters will need to be ready for senior care – at a minimum, that will be annual checkups including senior bloodwork and a dental post adoption (most senior rescues need one).

Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Thier Foster Parent Says: ""In less than 12 hours Odie has quickly decided that he’s a city guy. He is a showstopper on the streets rocking his silky coat and middle part. He is pretty unphased by city life and loves to go for a long walk or accompany you on your errands. He enjoys saying hello to other dogs on the street and will try to jump up and say hi to strangers at times. He is quickly getting the hang of leash walking and does all his business outside- in a day or two he’ll be a pro at the leash. He is extremely affectionate and will climb into your lap gently for cuddles and lick your whole face clean. He loves to be pet, but prefers to find a cozy spot on the carpet or dog bed to nap. At home he will play with his toys on his own or occupy himself with a chew, while keeping a close eye on you. It honestly doesn’t get more perfect than this southern gentleman."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: This dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60-90 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Medical status Healthy as far as we know.

(This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably! Adults usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. A consistent walking route and schedule plus finding spots with grass or dirt can help. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some like to wrestle with every passing pup, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Not sure yet! Some breed mixes that are generally NOT great matches for homes with cats include large hounds, huskies, and shepherds. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet.

During her first few days, she preferred to stay in her crate, quietly observing her new surroundings. With patience, time and some treats, she is trusting and approaching. She enjoys her meal time, hops and follows around while we are preparing her meals. She enjoys short breaks and is looking to run back into her crate once she is done exploring. She did fine when interacting with our two dogs both indoor and outdoor. She’s calm, quiet, and happiest in a peaceful home with minimal disturbances.""

Senior care can also take an emotional toll on their humans. Adopting a mature pup is a wonderful thing to do, but it can also be difficult. Energy level LOWER: Pretty chill indoors and won’t demand endless amounts of stimulation and exercise but still needs a few short walks a day (10-30 min each) for potty breaks and to stretch their legs City Suitability: Would not do well in a busy city. She’s easily spooked by noises and prefers a calm, slow-paced environment. She’d be perfect for someone in the suburbs or countryside. Potty Training: She’s potty trained to go outside during yard breaks but also uses wee pads inside her playpen if needed. Strangers: Shy at first, but very food motivated. Positive reinforcement goes a long way with her — treats help her open up quickly. Other Dogs: She’s okay with calm dogs who keep to themselves after the initial sniff. She’s not playful or social with other dogs and generally prefers her own space. Kids: Okay with respectful adults. Young kids could scare her. Cats: Yes. Seniors are usually mellow enough that they are able to coexist well with cats. Mouthy Behavior: None. She has no interest in chewing or grabbing anything she’s not supposed to. Separation: Fine being left alone. She mostly naps or relaxes quietly. Leash Skills: Not good on leash. She prefers being off-leash in a secure yard and doesn’t enjoy going for walks on a leash. Cuddles: She’s not clingy, but she likes being around people she trusts. Not a lap dog, but will lie nearby. Crate: She uses her crate when she wants quiet time. No issues with crating when needed.

All puppies go through phases where they chew your stuff and grab your hands, arms, feet… puppies naturally explore the world, play, and test boundaries with their mouths. (It also happens when they’re teething.) Their teeth are super sharp though, so it can be a very painful phase for humans and other animals in the home. Proper training, outlets, and socialization are key. Separation anxiety: MEDIUM: Most puppies have some level of separation anxiety as they learn to self soothe. Often they cry the first 10+ minutes when they are left home alone or in a crate. Consistent training and alone time is crucial. Leash manners: None. :) Will need to learn this skill. Crate trained? Nope. None of our new puppies have been formally trained, but many of our foster parents/adopters choose to crate train. It can be a great way to keep puppies safe and teach them independence. Medical status: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

Their Foster Parent Says: ""Ted is a sweet, loving boy who loves treats, bones, and exploring the city. He does great in all kinds of public situations and will accompany you on your walk to the coffee shop or to a fun pet-friendly store! He is very treat-motivated but is polite with his meals and likes to graze throughout the day. Napping in a cozy blanket while watching reality TV is one of his favorite afternoon activities. He is very curious about what the people are up to and will follow to observe you (just in case you're getting a treat). Ted would love a backyard that he can freely explore and hang out in when the weather is nice, but he also loves wandering around the city, so it's not a must. Ted is very patient and doesn't mind when you leave, he will curl up and snooze or stare out the window while you're away.

Francis,Puppy,Female,Chihuahua,"FRANCIS - 8 months & 10lbs (as of 10/14), Chi Mix, Spayed Estimated to Be About 15lbs Full Grown This puppy is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Our Team Says: ""Francis needs a home in a calm area. She's not fully a city girl. Calm areas and beyond are best for this girl!"" Thier Foster Parents Says: ""Francis is a sweet, silly and rambunctious gal who is very shy at first but really bursts out of her shell once she’s comfortable. She’s curious about the world around her and is always the first one to investigate new items at home (she is not this brave out in the wild). Fran loves to play hard but loves to nap just as much! Fran loves a good sunbathing moment and will always look for a sunny spot around the house to bask in. She loves going on walks especially with her K9 foster brother (her preferred company), but is very hesitant to do her business in new places, the slower the pace the better. Though she is a very friendly pup, she shies away from strangers out in public, she prefers slow meet and greets. She’s a big cuddle bug, and loves behind the ear scratches. Francis loves following her human around when they're home, on my work from home days she can be found hanging out in my study with her foster brother or napping by my feet while I take a meeting. True to her inner chihuahua nature, this small gal has a small but mighty bark, especially when she gets spooked, she’s not a fan of surprises or loud noises. Fran can be a little stubborn (especially when it involves an early morning wake up) but overall, is a very good girl!"" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Cuddle Bug Level Medium — Likes to snuggle when he's in the mood but often stays in his own bed Potty Trained Sort of — On the way and learning! may be using wee pads (is a puppy or a brand new rescue) Comfy with strangers? Nope — Quite the wallflower, very shy with new people and takes a while to warm up. Afraid when unfamiliar people try to say hi on the street, hides or shrinks back when new people visit the home. Good with Children? (ALWAYS requires supervision) Yes for 12 and up — may be a little energetic or a little skittish, best with older children that can be extra gentle or that are big enough not to get accidentally knocked down Good with Other Dogs? Mostly — Generally good with other dogs but may be picky (scared of big dogs or plays too rough for small dogs, for example) Good with Other Animals? (cats, small pets, etc.) Francis is still too unsure of the world around to notice the birds and squirrels she encounters on her walks. Mouthy Behavior? Low – Little to no interest in chewing on stuff or putting things in its mouth that aren’t food. Doesn’t try to chew on hands, feet, etc. during playtime, doesn’t wreck your stuff — only chews on appropriate things like dog toys and bones. Leash Manners? Getting the Hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in its life but he/she is figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. Okay in the city? Nope — Needs a home out of the city! Jumping on People to Say Hi? Medium – Jumps up only on people the dog knows when really excited. Stops with correction. Separation Anxiety? Medium – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone. Crate training? Not at all – Don’t even have one, I’ve puppy proofed and we free range. Medical status: Healthy as far as we know.

Aslan,Puppy,Male,Border Collie/Labrador Retriever,"Aslan - 7 months, 35lbs, Collie Mix, Neutered Estimated to be about 45lbs full grown This puppy is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) POTTY TRAINED? Working on this skill. Puppies under 12 weeks old are often on track with their wee pad skills, but they’re too young to walk outside in public NYC areas yet because they haven’t finished their puppy vaccine series. Puppies older than 12 weeks are usually learning to do their business outside. Potty training takes a lot of patience, consistency, and clean up. SOCIAL WITH DOGS? Yes. Some puppies are shy, others are bold, but all have the potential to be taught healthy socializing skills. It’s a huge part of raising a puppy and must be done carefully. How they interact with other dogs depends largely on how their humans help them learn to. SOCIAL WITH CHILDREN? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) Yes… but most puppies are not a great match for a home with kids under age 8 because they go through intense mouthy play and rambunctious phases and often accidentally hurt young kids while playing. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. SOCIAL WITH CATS? Yes. Almost all puppies have the potential to be friends with a cat. It’s on the adopter to know their cat’s temperament and preferences and to teach their puppy respectful manners. MOUTHY PLAY: High! All puppies go through phases where they chew your stuff and grab your hands, arms, feet… puppies naturally explore the world, play, and test boundaries with their mouths. (It also happens when they’re teething.) Their teeth are super sharp though, so it can be a very painful phase for humans and other animals in the home. Proper training, outlets, and socialization are key. SEPARATION ANXIETY MEDIUM: Most puppies have some level of separation anxiety as they learn to self soothe. Often they cry the first 10+ minutes when they are left home alone or in a crate. Consistent training and alone time is crucial. LEASH MANNERS: None. :) Will need to learn this skill. CRATE TRAINED: Nope. None of our new puppies have been formally trained, but many of our foster parents/adopters choose to crate train. It can be a great way to keep puppies safe and teach them independence. MEDICAL STATUS: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon HOW DID THIS DOG END UP WITH US? Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives.

Fried Pickles,Young,Female,Mixed Breed,"Meet Fried Pickles! She’s the smartest, friendliest, most loyal pup you’ll ever meet. Her energy level is right in the middle—not too hyper, but always up for some fun. She’ll bark occasionally and can be pretty vocal when playing with other dogs or when feeling territorial. The only time she has issues with other dogs is when possessive over toys or food, so being the only dog in the household would be best. She’s getting better at walking on a leash and still pulls a little, but she's smart, food-motivated and trainable, so it's getting better. With treats she’ll happily follow along and try not to get distracted too much by squirrels, rabbits and scooters. Super food-driven and smart, she already knows a lot of commands like “sit, stay, down, roll, kiss, paw, leave it, come, play dead"". She loves giving her paw—sometimes without even being asked!

Thier Foster Parent Says: "" Tink is a very sweet girl. She’s the biggest cuddle bug and definitely thinks she’s a lap dog. She’s a good sleeper throughout the night and just stays in the bed with you until you get it. So no waking you up in the morning. She loves her morning walks in the park and saying hi to everyone she can. Silly girl does like to eat things off the ground so got to watch out for that but good news she will let you grab whatever she’s eating out of mouth without a fight. She is not food aggressive in any way. I don’t think she knows any commands but does understand the word no. Sadly she does not play with any toys! She doesn’t know what to do with them! Maybe it’s something she will learn in time. Safe to say she doesn’t tear anything up though, all your shoes and furniture are safe. She if the biggest lover girl and will be attached to your side."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: This dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60-90 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Cuddle bug level? EXTRA CUDDLY, wants to be in the lap at all times Potty trained? yes, had accident very first day but understandable she was adjusting! No more since then Comfy with strangers? Yes! She LOVES people and wants to say hi to everyone, gentle girl Comfortable with children? not sure, she’s not jumpy with it comes to people and wags her tail when walking past kids but so far no interaction Social with other dogs? needs some work, gets extremely excited and cries/jumps towards all dogs. I wouldn’t say unfriendly but needs to learn some manners. I think other dogs are unsure of her excitement. We need to have longer interactions so see how she is Respectful of other animals? she’s currently in a home with 3 cats. So far good but has a tendency to want to chase when they run fast. 1/10 times she will react towards them. Most of the down she just lays on the couch and ignores them. Maybe a house with one dominant cat would be ok! Mouthy behavior? soooo quiet does not bark at all, maybe heard her bark twice, unless wanting to meet other dogs! Leash manners? she pulls in the beginning, a little zig zaggy but after 15 minutes or so she’s walks along side of you Okay in the city? she prefers a quieter area with more space(currently in ridgewood) she has been in the city but gets overstimulated with all the people and dogs so close Jumping on people to say hi? not really, if you are sitting she wants to prop herself on you Separation anxiety? so far no crying just sleeps on the couch Crate no crate Medical status Healthy as far as we know.

Bo ,Adult,Male,American Staffordshire Terrier/Mixed Breed,"Meet Bo, a lovable boy whose journey began in March 2020 when he found his forever home. Unfortunately, Bo's owner passed away, leading this beloved boy back into our care once again. Bo is an outgoing and friendly companion who adores being the center of attention. Bo loves to chew on stuffies and Kongs, sleeps peacefully through the night, and is always eager to curl up beside you on the couch. He doesn’t beg for people food, but will come barreling into the kitchen when any bag is open (smart boy!). We suspect Bo lived a pretty sheltered life; he doesn’t seem comfortable around the other dogs, and the busy city makes him anxious. But at our Center, he is a lovable, affectionate, easygoing guy. We have no doubts that he’ll flourish in any loving home outside the city. He's a very well-rounded dog. He is housetrained and walks well on leash, but can be reactive/overexcited when he sees other dogs. He loves car rides and will greet you with a toy and a wagging tail every time you come home. He's a very loyal, happy dog, and we cannot wait to see him in a loving home where he belongs. Please complete an application today to learn more about Bo. All dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption. Please note that the listed location for this dog may not be accurate due to technical limitations of this database and we have transportation options available within 6 hours of NYC (so don't let location hold you back)!

Timmy,Young,Male,Chihuahua/Terriers (Small),"Timmy - 9 months & 11lbs (as of 10/15), Chi Mix, Neutered Estimated around 13lbs full grown This puppy is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Their Foster Parent Says: ""When I say that Timmy had me falling absolutely head over heels in LOVE with him in less than 2 hours... He is an absolute delight and the MOST delicious little boy I've ever laid eyes on. He is gentle and sweet, curious and excited, and the most perfect blend of chill and fun. I truly don't know what more anyone could ask for. He's potty trained, sleeps through the night, doesn't bark, and hasn't chewed anything in my apartment (except his toys, as he should! He loves chewing toys). When he came to me, I was warned that he was timid and scared easily (which is true), but every day I have watched him challenge himself and become braver. I'm so proud of his progress. He will follow me around my apartment and offer up several kisses and hugs, which is wild because he was pretty terrified of kisses at first. (CUDDLE SHOULD BE HIS MIDDLE NAME THOUGH. He is the sweetest soul for anyone in search of a snuggly little bug.) At the same time, he will also initiate playtime with my 9 year old dog when he gets his zoomies and follow her lead on all our walks; it has been so sweet watching him look to her for guidance. It seems like she's helped him realize the world isn't such a scary place. With that being said, I would definitely recommend a home in a quieter neighborhood (and with a dog, if possible -- especially one that's not super timid, so he can continue to learn from them). For a dog that's so shy, he has been very quick to trust and love and make his way into my heart, so he is the most deserving of a home that will give him all that love right back. He enjoys exploring and sniffing everything on our daily walks (and we have even been able to increase his longer walk of the day to about 60-75 mins). Sometimes we pass a dog on the street that will give him some anxiety, so he may briefly growl a little bit, but otherwise, we can usually walk by them relatively easily. And it may be a challenge teaching him some basic commands like ""sit,"" because he gets a bit overwhelmed and backs up if you reach your arm out at him too quickly. So I'd recommend a family who can be gentle and patient with him for that stuff and who will be very present for him (because even though he's shy, he definitely LOVES his human(s)). All in all, I truly cannot say enough positive things about his behavior, personality, and stunning good looks. He's a charmer, and whoever adopts him is quite simply the luckiest."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.)

Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. POTTY TRAINING - At this point, I don't even have pee pads out (I left them out the first couple days, but he never used them and he had no accidents). So I would definitely say he's potty trained! Yes – Few or no accidents COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS - He's definitely been shy around the few friends I've introduced him to, but he's not hiding or anything. He just tends to stay close to me (if we're in my apt, he'll come sit by me), or if we've been outside, he'll just sit in my lap or lean back into my arms). But he's not avoiding the new people altogether - he seems to be curious, and I'm sure with enough constant socialization he will open up with time. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) - Would be okay in a home with respectful teenagers and older. SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS - In my house, he's been nothing but amazing around my dog (and she's been gentle and kind to him, as well, which has been great!). He definitely looks up to her and looks to her for guidance and wants to be near her a lot, so I think he would do VERY well in a home with another dog(s) (I think it would be especially helpful for him so he can get out of his shell even more). On our walks, there have been a few bigger dogs that have gotten him nervous, but he did stop and give a dog a few kisses today! I was very impressed! SOCIAL WITH CATS? Yes. Almost all puppies have the potential to be friends with a cat. It’s on the adopter to know their cat’s temperament and preferences and to teach their puppy respectful manners. MOUTHY BEHAVIOR - On the rare occasion he will try to put my fingers in his mouth when we're cuddling (BUT it's not in a teething or trying to bite me type of way - it's always been very gentle and VERY brief). He hasn't really chewed anything major in my home that he isn't supposed to (he did pick up a coaster and nibbled on that for a minute, but that's about it). Past this stage– Little to no interest in chewing on stuff or putting things in their mouth that aren’t food. Doesn’t try to chew on hands, feet, etc. during playtime SEPARATION ANXIETY (Please leave your foster dog home alone every day for at least 20 minutes.)Adjusting – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone otherwise. LEASH MANNERS - I would say he pulls a little at times or gets a bit scared by a noise and will abruptly stop walking or hop to a side or something. But all in all, I'd say he's pretty good on the leash and we're working on increasing the length of our walks. We've had a few that were 60-90 mins, and he has been loving them! Getting the hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in their life but figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. CUDDLE BUG LEVEL - I would say he is VERY snuggly and cuddly - I would say somewhere between medium and high depending on the day/time. We were initially having him sleep in his little bed on the ground next to my bed (where I sleep with my dog), and the past couple nights he's hopped up into my bed and slept with us there. He likes to come cuddle on the couch with me as well, but I also leave his bed on my couch during the day, so he'll cuddle up in there a lot as well. JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO - I think because of his shyness and being easily spooked, he hasn't yet explored jumping on people or dogs, but he does jump on me when I come home out of excitedness. For other people though, it's usually very calm! He definitely follows me around the house though! Calm Greetings – Doesn’t jump up on people or dogs. Always all four on the floor. CRATE TRAINING - I wasn't given a crate when I picked up Timmy, so we've been just going with it and letting him free in the apartment, even when I leave. So far, this has not been an issue How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee or St. Thomas.

Luke,Senior,Male,"Terrier/Westie, West Highland White Terrier","Are you looking for a loyal companion whose only goal is to love and be loved? Meet Luke, a senior dog who has been waiting patiently for a quiet home to call his own. Luke is an incredibly sweet boy who truly aims to please. It's clear he hasn't had the easiest life, as he can be a bit head shy, but his capacity for forgiveness is immense. All he wants is a gentle hand and a person to dote on. To help Luke find the perfect retirement home, a generous anonymous donor has sponsored a portion of his adoption fee! (Luke's adoption fee is $150) We've made sure Luke is all set for his new beginning. He's had a full senior bloodwork panel and a recent dental cleaning (including x-rays and extractions). Like many seniors, he has some age-related aches and anxiety, but both are easily managed with affordable daily medication. He also has some ""Westie skin itchies,"" which are common and manageable. He's had great relief with a monthly injection and daily Benadryl. Luke's Ideal Home: He needs to be the only pet in the home. While he's friendly with other dogs on leash, he wants to be the king of his own castle and soak up all your attention. A calm, adult-only household is best. He needs a home without small children (now or in the future) to help him feel safe and secure. This wonderful, resilient boy has so much love left to give. Could you be the one to show him what a true forever home feels like? Vaccinated for rabies, DHPP, bordetella, and Lepto. Neutered and microchipped. Current on flea, tick, and heartworm prevention. To apply to adopt Luke, visit our website ( www.waggytailrescue.org ) for a foster application. It is important to fill out an application as soon as possible for consideration, and we require a complete application for you to meet an animal. We are currently unable to respond to general email inquiries as an all-volunteer run rescue. If the dog is on our website, they are still available. Waggytail Rescue CANNOT guarantee the exact age of any adoptable dog, or final size of any of our adoptable puppies.

Prepare to be amazed by Chewy, a vibrant 12-year-old Chihuahua who defies his age with boundless energy and a remarkable zest for life! This little guy is a testament to resilience, a true survivor with a charming, spicy side. Thanks to exceptional care, Chewy is incredibly healthy and feeling his absolute best. He's beautifully settled into foster life, rediscovering trust and learning the joy of a secure environment. While he navigates the world being newly blind, it certainly doesn't slow down this energetic senior! He's looking for a compassionate adopter who will appreciate his spirited nature and help him continue to thrive at his own gentle pace. Watch him blossom further with time, understanding, and all the tender loving care you can offer! Chewy has made tremendous progress learning to use pee pads in his foster home (he's also a pro at napping on the job when visiting his foster mom's hospital – she's a great vet!). And don't worry about his occasional grumbles – with a full mouth extraction, his bite is all bark and no ouch!

Chiquito,Adult,Male,Chihuahua/Terriers (Small),"Meet Chiquito! Chiquito is a 5-year-old, 22-pound male dachshund terrier mix from Alabama! Chiquito is a cuddly, cozy, loving pup looking for a place to nap and someone willing to throw a toy for him to chase. Chiquito has adjusted beautifully to life in Brooklyn, and is eager to go on walks in the neighborhood and meet as many neighborhood pups as possible. Chiquito lives to fetch and then curl up in a lap for a long nap. Chiquito is doing well understanding “sit” “wait” “shake” and working on other obedience training. During his time with his foster family, he seems to be house trained, and does a great job letting them know when it’s time to go outside by politely walking in circles by the door. He is good on a leash and still working on ignoring other dogs while out and about (he really reeeeally wants to make friends.) Chiquito's forever family will need to continue working with him to reinforce and advance the progress he’s been making with learning to commands and staying focused on leash. Chiquito has done well in his crate during the day - he may whimper a bit, but does a good job of self soothing and going to sleep after a few minutes. He loves to be cozy with his foster family and can often be found with his favorite meercat plushie. Chiquito is looking for a lowkey family that will take him out for walks and snuggle up with him nearby. He appreciates downtime and active moments, with a solid mix of cuddles and playtime during the day. He can keep himself occupied with a chew toy for hours, and loves to search for treats. He would do well as a solo dog or with other dogs in the house. We would recommend Chiquito go to a home with older children. Vaccinated for rabies, DHPP, and bordetella, neutered and microchipped. Negative for heartworm disease, and current on flea, tick, and heartworm prevention. To apply for Chiquito, visit our website ( www.waggytailrescue.org ) for an adoption application.

Loreen,Adult,Female,Schnauzer (Miniature)/Maltese,"Loreen - 5 years, 7lbs, Maltese/Shnazuer Mix, Spayed Want to adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Our Team Says: Loreen needs a home out of the city. She is NOT a city girl. Burbs and beyond are ideal for her. She would also do great with another dog in the home :) Our Foster Parent Says: "" Loreen is a very sweet girl who still has her puppy moments. She has zoomies, especially when you come home after work of if you were just gone for 2 minutes. She recently discovered her love of toys and gathers each one of them into her bed. Unfortunately she hasn’t quite figured out toy vs non-toy yet but she’s easily redirected. Her bed is her safe space, especially when she’s has her anxious moments. When Loreen initially came to NYC from Tennessee she was very scared being in a city setting and shook for an entire week. She was then relocated to Long Island with me and the quiet environment has really let her true self show. She has slowly warmed up to being outside and now runs around happily in my yard and is learning to enjoy walks. Having another confident dog is definitely a plus! She often looks to my dog Kiba when she gets nervous and even follows him around sometimes. At home she is a cuddle bug and loves to be near you. She politely asks for airlifts onto the bed but occasionally gives a sassy bark or two to get your attention. She does well with baths and brushing, she’s also happy to be dressed! She’s very good with both of my cats and my dog, she’s very neutral around everyone and does not show any signs of guarding issues. She did well around a 3 year old boy and generally does well with everyone, she is occasionally anxious with new people. Overall she is a go with the flow type of girl and follows her people around."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: This dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm negative; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Puerto Rico or Southern California. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though! This animal is not at the Social Tees office, all are in foster homes.

Prince Hans,Senior,Male,Australian Shepherd/Doberman Pinscher,"**Located in Korea** Rescue Story: Prince Hans is a remarkable dog with an even more remarkable story. Rescued from deplorable conditions at a gas station, he endured a life of neglect, tied up and surviving on coffee and food scraps. His life took a turn for the better when a compassionate resident, who had cared for him and another dog named Sleeping Beauty, stepped in to save them from an uncertain and bleak future. Physical Description: Prince Hans is a medium-sized mixed-breed dog with striking features. His coat is a handsome blend of caramel and white, with soulful brown eyes that speak volumes of his resilience and longing for a loving home.

Barking: You'll hardly hear a peep from Prince Hans. He's a quiet and composed companion who prefers to listen and observe. Leash Manners: After three months of dedicated training, Prince Hans has transformed from a strong leash-puller into a well-behaved walker. He now strolls calmly by your side, making walks a pleasure for both of you. Appetite: Prince Hans has a hearty appetite and eagerly devours his meals. He's not a picky eater and enjoys a well-balanced diet. Bathing: While he may not particularly enjoy bath time, Prince Hans patiently stands still. He's a cooperative dog who understands that some things are part of the grooming routine. Treats and Walks: Prince Hans lights up when it's treat time or time for a leisurely walk. These are some of his favorite activities, and you'll see his excitement shine through during these moments. Otherwise, he's content to lounge quietly and relax. Training: Prince Hans already knows commands like ""Sit"" and ""Stay,"" which is a testament to his intelligence and eagerness to please. He's a quick learner and is ready to embark on further training adventures with his new family. Ideal Home: Prince Hans would thrive in a calm and loving home where he can continue to heal from his past experiences. He's a perfect fit for individuals or families seeking a loyal and low-energy companion who appreciates the simple pleasures in life. He would do well in a home with a secure yard for leisurely strolls and playtime. Adoption Notes: Prince Hans has come a long way from the gas station where he was found. He's a survivor with a heart of gold, and all he's looking for now is a forever home filled with love, patience, and understanding. If you're ready to open your heart to this resilient and gentle soul, Prince Hans will reward you with unwavering loyalty and a lifetime of companionship.

Dot,Adult,Female,Jack Russell Terrier,"Dot is a sweet little lady who is still learning how to trust humans, experience the joy of being a dog, and enjoy the sights, sounds and smells of NYC. She was surrendered by a breeder and is most comfortable in her crate, but she is coming out of her shell and exploring the apartment more and more. We're working to help her get desensitized to noises and she's making great progress. Dot allows us to hold her in our laps and stroke her but definitely prefers her crate. She loves walking outside and will voluntarily come out of the crate to be leashed. She also enjoys being taken on errands in her dog carrier and sticks her head out to see what's happening. In the park she sniffs the ground and is curious about other dogs -- she will approach them and allows herself to be sniffed without fear. She especially likes the freedom of a long leash in the park. She is also very treat motivated in the apartment -- outdoors she seems to be more on high alert and rarely takes a treat.

Drama,Puppy,Female,Australian Shepherd/Labrador Retriever,"Drama - 14 weeks & 19lbs (as of 10/31), Aussie Mix, Spayed Estimated full grown size around 60lbs This puppy is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Thier Foster Parents Say: ""Drama doesn’t live up to her name in the best way. She’s brilliant, incredibly well behaved, pretty chill throughout the day, and loves to go for walks and play respectfully with our dog. She’s wonderful on a leash - it’s actually really impressive. She has been going to the bathroom outside and on pee pads inside. She has also let us know when she needs to get off of our couch or bed for a potty break. Drama is cuddly and affectionate, pretty independent and doesn’t mind resting by herself or hanging out with a toy or bully stick. She’s food motivated and a great listener - Drama will be an absolute joy to train. She responds to corrections and redirection extremely well. Whoever adopts Drama will be so lucky to have her. She has the best temperament and tons of potential - she is truly a rare find."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) TOLERANCE TO CITY City pup – Seems unfazed by the sights and sounds, may as well have been born here. POTTY TRAINING Sort of -- On the way and learning! May be using wee pads (is a puppy or a brand new rescue) COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS Social butterfly – Wants to be friends with everyone who walks by, loves anyone who will stop to say hello. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Yes for most ages – very confident, gentle, low energy, tolerant, not mouthy SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Yes – Good with most other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc.) Not sure – Wants to chase squirrels and birds so may not be a good match for a home with cats, rabbits, etc. MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Past this stage– Little to no interest in chewing on stuff or putting things in their mouth that aren’t food. Doesn’t try to chew on hands, feet, etc. during playtime SEPARATION ANXIETY (Please leave your foster dog home alone every day for at least 20 minutes.) Past this stage – Completely fine being left home alone. Doesn’t cry or exhibit destructive behavior when you leave the apartment or house. LEASH MANNERS Getting the hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in their life but figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. CUDDLE BUG LEVEL Medium – Likes to snuggle when he's in the mood but often stays in his own bed JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Needs training – Very excited to greet everyone and has no idea how to do so politely. Jumps up on most strangers or other dogs that go by. In puppy phase or wasn’t trained as a young adult. CRATE TRAINING Working on it – We set one up and leave the door open but rarely close it because the dog freaks out *We haven’t used the crate much but are working on it. She’s a calm girl overall and not super needy, so I’m confident she will do fine. MEDICAL STATUS: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon HOW DID THIS DOG END UP WITH US? Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though! This animal is not at the Social Tees office, all are in foster homes.

Chat,Adult,Female,Shih Tzu,"Hello everyone, glad you've made it to my profile! My name is Chat and I am a little 6 year old retired breeding mama that was used to just make puppies my whole life. I am getting use to life inside a loving home and just learning my surroundings. I do not ask for much but for someone who can be patient and kind to me as I have not had that before. I am working on my potty training and doing very well, just a few accidents here and there, but my foster mommy said that's normal. I feel more comfortable with dogs than humans as they have not treated me the best. I do not ever growl or show aggression, however sudden movements, loud noises, and being in unfamiliar places or people gets me anxious and causes me to shake. I definitely am a suburbs kind of girl and would do best in a quite home to help me flourish , loud noises or alarms can be very scary for me. As of right now I am definitely SMALL dog friendly, bigger dogs can be scary to me as I am a small girl. I probably wouldn't mind cats but not tested with them as of yet (soon to come though) I also have not been tested with children yet as my foster mommy is helping me decompress (will be introduced soon to confirm) However, she thinks I would do best in a home with older children, who can understand my needs and understand to give me time to come out of my shell and understand my shyness. My foster mommy thinks I am mixed with another breed of some sort, my hair is straight, doesn't seem to shed, and my hair dries super quick after my baths! I am quite calm and good for people who don't care about too much physical activity outside my potty walks. I like to lay in the grass and in the shade breathing in the fresh air, giving a few snorts here and there. I am doing a great job learning to potty outside, a quick 5-10 minute walk is all I need, right now getting walked 4x a day. I do not pull and quite easy to walk, but make sure you hold onto my leash in case I get scared. I adore my food very much and that is what I've been most excited about other than meeting other doggie friends. Unfortunately I have not had treats yet but that will hopefully change soon because they smell really tasty but I haven't been motivated to eat them yet, although offered. My foster doggie name in the house is what my original name was, Oreo (I respond best to that) ! I can't wait to meet you and find a great loving forever home that I deserved from the start !

Karlena is still recovering from a traumatic past life, but as each day passes, so grows her confidence. This little girl is the definition of brave and strong, but she is still learning more each day that she can trust humans after the ones in her past have let her down time and time again. Karlena is still getting accustomed to living inside with her foster parents and isn't ready yet to go outside for walks, but she's been a quick learner with pee pads.

Karlena will thrive with adoptive parents who are understanding, patient, and willing to meet her where she is and not rush her, and continue to foster a safe, calm and quiet environment for her to decompress, heal, and learn to trust.

Coda,Young,Female,Mixed Breed,"Meet Coda (known to her foster as Opera) — the sweetest soul waiting for her chance at a real life. Opera is a gentle, about one-year-old mixed-breed pup (very likely with some AmStaff in her), and she is looking for a patient, loving home where she can finally feel safe. Opera has been through more than any dog should. She was found with a severe injury to her neck and brought to a county shelter in Tifton, Georgia, where she got surgery to heal. She is 100% better health wise, but the emotional scars still remain. She arrived scared, shut down, and unsure of the world — but every day she shows us that she wants to trust. With quiet routines, kindness, and a calm environment, she is already making small, meaningful steps forward. Opera has not shown an ounce of agressivesness. Her instinct is to freeze when she is unsure or scared. She loves her food, responds beautifully to a soft voice, and finds comfort in having a cozy spot of her own. Once she feels secure, her sweet personality shines through. Opera will absolutely blossom with someone willing to give her time, consistency, and reassurance. If you’ve ever wanted to witness a transformation — to help a fearful dog discover joy, play, and confidence — Opera is your girl. She deserves a family that will love her gently, at her pace, and celebrate every victory along the way. If your home has patience, love, and calm, Opera will give you her whole heart.

Sugarberry,Adult,Female,Mixed Breed,"Meet Sugarberry — affectionately known as “Suggy”! Sugarberry is a 6-year-old southern sweetheart who recently traded country roads for city sidewalks — and she’s been stealing hearts ever since.

While loud noises can startle her, Sugarberry has been adjusting beautifully to the hustle and bustle of New York City. She’s fully potty trained, friendly with all people and most dogs, and loves spending time with her humans. Sugarberry would thrive in a calm, patient home that can continue helping her build confidence around other dogs. In return, she’ll offer endless love, loyalty, and quiet companionship.

Sycamore,Adult,Male,Jack Russell Terrier,"Meet Sycamore! 🐾 Sycamore is a 5-year-old Jack Russell Terrier with a bright mind, a playful spirit, and a heart ready to grow. At 15 lbs, this energetic little guy is a true JRT—full of curiosity, cleverness, and a zest for life. A former breeder dog, Sycamore has made incredible progress in just a few weeks of fostering. What was once a shy dog who wouldn’t accept touch is now happily letting himself be petted (with a little patience) and even carried. He’s eager to be part of the action, loves to play, and is highly motivated by food—treats are the key to his heart and his learning! Sycamore is crate trained, sleeps quietly through the night, and is almost fully house trained. He enjoys walks and exploring the outdoors, though new sights and sounds can sometimes startle him. A patient family who understands his need for gentle guidance will help him continue building confidence. He thrives with other dogs and would especially love a home with a confident canine companion to show him the ropes. A yard where he can safely run and burn off energy would be ideal. If you’re looking for a smart, food-loving, and affectionate companion who will blossom with patience and love, Sycamore is ready to meet his forever family!

Glinda,Adult,Female,Shiba Inu/Jindo,"**Located in Korea** Meet Glinda! She is surely going to be pop-u-lar! Rescue Story: As a puppy, she went home with a family that had four children. The kids begged to have a dog and, without any preparation, they family decided to adopt. As she grew, she began to shed, and the children became frightened. They decided to tie her up in the parking lot and left her there, neglected, for two years.

Kloe,Young,Female,Mixed Breed,"Meet Kloe! Meet Kloe: The Chill Queen with a Heart of Gold (and a Nose Boop to Prove It) If you're looking for a dog who can handle the chaos of life with grace and a dash of humor, look no further than Kloe. Tantruming toddlers? She offers a comforting nose boop, then gracefully removes herself from the drama like the mature queen she is, even at the young age of two years old. Kloe is the gold standard of gentle play—excited zoomies with adults, four-on-the-floor patience with kids, and not a single snatchy move in sight. She takes treats like a lady, has no interest in guarding resources, and frankly doesn’t even notice if someone strolls past her food. (We don’t recommend toddler taste-testing her kibble, but you get the vibe.) Her nighttime routine? Legendary. She potty breaks at 6pm and calls it a day. Even if you beg her from the backyard in your PJs, she’ll be upstairs in bed like, “Nah, I’m good.” She sleeps through the night like a champ and waits patiently for you to rise, whether it's 6am or a lazy Sunday 8am. Car rides? Loves them. Visitors? Welcomes them. Delivery people? Whatever. Kloe is unfazed by the world’s noise and just wants to vibe, cuddle, and be your loyal sidekick. One thing to know: Kloe prefers her personal space when it comes to other dogs. She’s not the dog park type, and that’s okay—she’d much rather be your one-and-only. With people, she’s a total lovebug; with other pups, she appreciates a little distance and respectful boundaries. Think of her as the introvert who loves her humans but doesn't feel the need to mingle with the whole dog block. She’s the full package: calm, kind, gentle, hilarious, house-trained, and delightfully opinionated about bedtime. Come meet the girl who’s got it all—Kloe’s ready to boop her way into your heart. 🌟 In the home: Extremely chill and well-mannered — not a jumper Total cuddlebug and wants to be snuggled up next to you — and any visitors — at all times Loves toys and playtime Potty trained and will stand by the door when she needs to go out Doesn’t chew furniture — or anything but squeaky toys :) Not mouthy — no play biting Loves lounging on the floor and only hops on the couch when invited Doesn’t beg for food — minds her own business during meals Loves to play fetch and has a special affinity for hoses :) Crate trained Patient & loving with toddler foster sister 🌟 On leash: Very treat-motivated and easy to redirect with a tasty snack We are still working on leash manners, but Kloe improves every day!

Meet Sunny , a magical 12-year-old scruffy Chi/Terrier mix. This 8.5-pound sweetie has a name that perfectly matches his goal: to find a patch of sun and snooze. Don't let his age fool you—Sunny is a spry guy with pep in his step! He loves walks, adores his humans, and is friendly with other dogs and cats. Sunny's Wish List: A patient, understanding human who can give him stability. A quiet, structured home where he can be the king of his own castle. A plush, comfy bed (he gives bonus points for a bolster so he can prop his head up! 🥰) What Sunny Needs: After so much change since leaving the shelter in early October, Sunny struggles with general anxiety and can be somewhat vocal. He just needs time, patience, and a predictable routine to help him settle and feel safe. This is your chance to give a deserving senior the one thing he wants: a stable, loving home to keep him comfortable for all his days. He is so deserving. The love you'll get back from this magical creature will be tenfold. Can you be Sunny's safe landing? Vaccinated for rabies, DHPP, and bordetella, heartworm negative, and microchipped. Current on flea, tick, and heartworm prevention. Sunny has a neuter appointment on January 15, 2026; this appointment will be covered by Waggytail Rescue, should Sunny be adopted.

Bombshells,Adult,Female,Mixed Breed,"Meet Bombshells (Nala) 💖 – a calm, sweet soul who’s slowly opening up to the joys of home life and companionship. Nala is a mellow, easygoing mama who recently arrived in NYC after raising a litter of pups. She’s still decompressing and adjusting to city life, but every day she’s becoming more trusting, more curious—and more ready for her next chapter. A little shy and scared at first, Nala finds her greatest joy outside with her doggy friends. She absolutely loves being around other pups—they help her feel safe and confident. (A home with a friendly resident dog would be a big plus!) She’s also cool with cats and seems comfortable around kids, though she hasn’t had much direct interaction just yet. Indoors, Nala is a quiet observer. She’s crate-trained, house-trained, and low-shedding. She is easy on her own at home, communicates when she needs to go out and walks beautifully on leash—calm, close, and with no pulling. She’s not a barker and has shown zero signs of aggression. Most of the day, she’s content to snooze in her crate or quietly explore a little more of her space. Her favorite hobby? Chillin’ 💤 Navigating the building lobby and elevator still makes her a bit nervous, but with gentle encouragement, she’s learning to get more comfortable and build trust in her surroundings. Nala is currently on heartworm medication and otherwise doing great—eating well, resting lots, and slowly blooming into the relaxed, loving companion we know she’s meant to be. She would thrive in a calm, loving home—especially one with other dogs—and with someone who’s happy to let her open up on her own terms. Ready to fall in love? Nala is waiting. 💕 Personality & Characteristics: Very calm and happy to be resting, happiest outside and around other dog friends My foster dog is good with: Loves being around other dogs, good with cats, seems good with kids but haven't had the opportunity for much interaction with kids yet (expect she would be fine!)

Savannah has been all fixed up and she is now doing well. Savannah is a sweet pup who is great with people of all ages. She must be the only dog in the home, and if there is another dog in the home (which we don't recommend), Savannah cannot be crated. Otherwise, Savannah does great in a crate! She currently sleeps all night in her crate and will rocket into the crate from anywhere in her foster home in response to the ""Crate Up"" command! She will also go into her open crate with a toy or snack and happily hang out there. Savannah is an excellent listener who will make a great companion! She is housetrained, knows basic commands and not destructive. She is easily overwhelmed with groups of dogs, and cannot visit dog parks.

He doesn't like cats and he doesn't like to be picked up; he likes to have his back rubbed, but if you hit the wrong spot, watch out! Gideon will do best in a home with snarky dog experience, where he can be independent, and if there are children they should be older and capable of respecting Gideon and his space. This guy's rough life has shaped him, and he deserves to spend the rest of his years in a loving, forever home with his special person who understands him and lets Gideon be Gideon. If you are Gideon's special person, please apply online to adopt Gideon (GA) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org.

Beau (SC),Adult,Male,Pit Bull Terrier,"Beau (SC) is a 70 lb. neutered male Pit Bull Terrier mix. Our veterinary partner estimated that Beau was 2 years old at the time of intake in September 2021. Beau is a super sweet, gentle, friendly boy who is good with people. Although Beau loves children, he's a big guy who doesn't know his own strength, so he would do best with teens and older. This beautiful boy was shot in the mouth while a drug warrant was being served; fortunately, the bullet lodged in Beau's neck in a spot that is not causing any pain or limitation. It was determined that it's best left there as the surgery to remove it is dangerous. Beau is a couch potato and LOVES to cuddle, is completely housebroken, enjoys car rides and does not chew or destroy anything (except for his toys which he loves to remove squeakers from). Beau would be perfect for a person or couple that doesn’t have other animals or has one submissive female (the only type of dogs he seems to get along with). He needs to be the center of attention so he can get all the love and attention he deserves. Beau is reactive to other dogs, so walking can be a bit challenging (he has a loud bark). Having a fenced in yard would be a plus. Beau can truly be your forever, loyal best friend if you crave pure unconditional love. You will be blessed to encounter this special guy. If you would like to star in Beau's new, improved life, please apply online to adopt Beau (SC) at www.rescuedogsrocknyc.org. ************************************************************************ RDR's adoption fees include the cost of spay/neuter/microchip at an RDR-approved facility, whether completed before adoption or if deferred because the pet is too young or has a medical issue.

I’m ready to find my forever person. Could it be you? I’m a certified snuggle bug. I’ll happily plop my giant self right into your lap like I’m a Chihuahua — personal space is overrated, right?

I adore humans — big ones, small ones, loud ones, quiet ones. If you’ve got a heartbeat, I want to be near it. I get along great with other pups. And most of all, I’m loyal to the core. Once I know you’re mine, I’ll be your shadow — following you from room to room, offering silent support, and maybe a slobbery kiss or two. Despite my rough past, I’m not bitter — I’m better. I’ve got so much love to give, and I’m just waiting for someone to give me a chance to show it. I’m Theo, your big-hearted best friend, your cuddle companion, your toy-toting goofball.

Freya,Young,Female,Jack Russell Terrier/Chihuahua,"Freya - 5 years, 17lbs, Jrt/Chi Mix, Spayed This dog is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably! Adults usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. A consistent walking route and schedule plus finding spots with grass or dirt can help. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some like to wrestle with every passing pup, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Not sure yet! Some breed mixes that are generally NOT great matches for homes with cats include large hounds, huskies, and shepherds. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico ; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

Tourmaline,Adult,Female,Mixed Breed,"Thanks to a generous supporter, my adoption fee has been fully covered! I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Tourmaline, or Tourmie for short. As many of us know (and for those who may not be aware), Tourmaline is the name of a popular gemstone that comes in many colors, and my particular color is brown. Not to brag, but when people first meet me, they always think I’m a young lady, but to tell the truth, I’m over 10 years old. It could be that I try to stay in shape (I love long walks and even short runs!). Since it’s not polite to ask a lady’s weight, I’ll tell you that I weigh about 50 pounds. It could be that as much as I like to just cuddle, have my tummy scratched, and generally just be loved (and give it back 10fold). Speaking of walks, I’m great on a leash. I sometimes do pull a little bit. I get a bit excited when I see other dogs being walked, but they're typically more interested in me than I am in them, so I'll just pass them by. I'm great with ALL humans, even kids! The only thing I’m not really fond of is being left by myself. I don’t make a mess, but I usually spend a couple of minutes calling out your name or asking you not to leave me alone. Of course, because we don’t speak the same language, to you, it just sounds like I’m barking. Otherwise, I’m very easygoing, especially when I’m snuggling, and I’m totally housebroken. I’ll sit when I’m told to and stay when I’m told. I don’t really like to play tug of war, but I've warmed up to ""fetch"". I do like to make sure my human is doing OK, so I sometimes follow him/her to whatever room they’re in if I notice they’re gone. This might be because I was abandoned. I don’t really remember how I was treated before I was found, so it could also be from then. I love the little treats my current human brings with us on walks. They also use them to help teach me new commands when we get back from walks. I'm even allowed to sleep on the bed overnight. The bottom line is that I’m just a bundle of love looking for someone to love and be loved by!",Medium,,True,Not Sure,Not Sure,True,True,,49 lbs,https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/petstablished-app-beta/uploads/image/image/5403443/IMG_9847__1_.jpg,https://petstablished.com/public/search/redirect?application_type=adoption&pet_id=2502562&premium=true,https://www.wagtopia.com/search/pet?id=2502562
Holly,Young,Female,Mixed Breed,"Meet Holly — Our Sweet Baby Hippo! Holly is a 60-pound cuddle bug in a tiny, low-rider package; more baby hippo than dog! She's got a big smushy head and even bigger ears, the perfect recipe to melt your heart. She’s a happy little soul who's sees the world as a place full of new friends and good snacks. Loud unfamiliar noises and environments can sometimes make her feel nervous. But if you let her go at her own pace and give her some reassurance, you'll see the silly, snuggly and playful dog she truly is. A little over 2 years old, Holly is as gentle as they come. Whether it's taking a treat or playing tug, she knows her stength and is very careful with it. She adores her toys and loves her people, so it’s no surprise that her favorite time of day is when she gets to enjoy both at once! While she can pull on the leash, she’s shown no reactivity towards dogs or the busy nyc streets. She is still polishing up on her leash manners — mostly because she’s so thrilled to be out exploring. But with positive reinforcement, she’s learning very quickly to walk by our side. Holly hasn’t met a person she doesn’t instantly adore. She’s a pro sleeper, pro cuddler, and gives the sweetest kisses. She’s fully potty trained and tells us exactly when she needs to go out — proof she’s mastered home life in no time. Holly came to the ACC as a scared stray and then spent weeks in a tiny pop-up crate. Now that she knows she's safe, her crate is a cozy, safe place and she'd be happy to snooze there while you're out. We’re not sure if Holly has had doggie siblings before, but with a slow introduction she’s done great with her four legged foster cousin in the suburbs! She’s a sweet, affectionate girl who gets very excited when meeting new friends — both two- and four-legged! She knows her basic commands like ""sit"", ""paw"" and ""wait"" but she's such a smart girl we're sure she'll learn anything you want to teach her. Like any true new yorker, she's an avid subway goer and has been the star of the show at every patio happy hour! We've also discovered that she absolutely loves bath time. She sits so patiently, soaking up all the scrubs and affection like a little spa queen. Friends of Holly say she's the ""cutest, sweetest, happiest and wiggliest little hippo you will ever meet!"" We’re already totally in love with her and we think you will be too.

Hagi,Adult,Male,Jindo,"Meet Hagi – Your Future Best Friend! 🐶💙 📸 Follow his journey on Instagram : @mariasfosterfriends Update 7/21/2025 He’s come so far and is so close to being ready for his forever home! Here’s what’s new: ✅ Getting comfortable with new people , especially women (approaches them on his own terms!) 🐶 Plays well with dogs outside his foster pack and thrives around other pups 🎽 Wears his collar confidently — leash training is up next! 🧠 Loves structure + routine , especially with other dogs to learn from 🏡 Needs a home with another friendly dog and a patient female adopter 💕 Still cautious with men , but has made major progress with foster dad 🎾 Total goofball with toys — obsessed with fetch, tug-of-war, and running zoomies Hagi’s goofy, gentle spirit continues to shine. With the right home, he’ll keep growing into the playful, confident pup we know he’s meant to be. 06/2025 Hagi is a 6-7 month-old Jindo mix who traveled all the way from South Korea and is slowly blooming into the quirky, cuddly pup he’s meant to be. He’s crate trained, potty trained, and a total pro with other dogs—big or small! In fact, he needs a doggy sibling to help show him the ropes and build up his trust in humans. He’s still a little shy around people (especially men) but is making sweet progress every day. Hagi’s not quite ready for walks just yet—leashes are still a little scary—but once he fully trusts his people, we’ll be working on that. For now, he’s happy to hang out at home, toss around a chew toy, or get in a solid nap while you work. He’s not the snuggly-in-your-arms type (yet!), but he’ll plop down next to you, sneak in some kisses, and lean in for scratchies when he’s feeling brave. And when he does feel brave? He’ll invite you to a game of fetch or tug like it’s the best day ever. Quick facts about Hagi: ✅ Potty trained and crate trained 🐶 Loves dogs—big, small, and everything in between 🧠 Knows basic commands like “sit,” “inside,” and “outside” 🏡 Must go to a home with another friendly dog 🎾 Favorite toys: balls, squeaky toys, and... socks! 🌞 Loves stretching out by the window and soaking up the sunshine If you’ve got a pup looking for a gentle playmate and the patience to help Hagi grow at his own pace, he just might be your perfect match. Backstory: These two adorable puppies were rescued from the streets of Korea, where they bravely survived by scavenging for scraps and even eating newspapers. Tragically, their mother was euthanized at the shelter they were taken to, but these resilient siblings have shown incredible strength and love despite their tough start.

Patron,Adult,Female,Mixed Breed,"Meet Patron! A soft-hearted sweetheart looking for her forever cuddle buddies. At 6 years old and 54 lbs, Patron is a true pocket-sized girl that often gets mistaken for a puppy. This beautiful mixed-breed girl is calm, quiet, and completely content to go at her own pace. She spent the first six years of her life in one home, so she’s now adjusting to big changes and is looking for a stable, loving forever family to help her feel safe again. Patron is an independent queen with a soft side. She may take a little time to warm up, but once she trusts you, she becomes incredibly loyal. She’s not overly clingy but will never turn down a chance to rest her head on your lap and soak up all of the scratches and cuddles. At home, she’s a total angel happy to snooze in her crate, relax on the couch, or hang nearby while you work. She’s house-trained, crate-trained, and fully okay being alone if you need to head out for a bit (and will be excited to run up to greet you when you get home!) Patron is super easygoing overall. She matches your schedule: want to sleep in? She’ll sleep in. Early riser? She’s with you. She’s the kind of pup that just wants to be your quiet companion through whatever the day brings. Patron would do best as the only dog in the home. Her relationship to other dogs seems to be based in curiousity and timidness versus aggression, but she will need some patience and support as she becomes more comfortable and confident around other dogs. Out on walks, she gets excited and pulls toward other dogs but with a bit of patience and structure, she’ll keep improving her leash manners. Patron is looking for someone with a gentle heart and a bit of patience, someone who will give her the space to bloom. And when she does, you’ll have the sweetest, most soulful dog by your side.

Thier Foster Parent Says: "" Apple is the sweetest and most lovable girl! She’s an incredibly gentle and well-behaved pup with a curious spirit. Most of the time, she’s calm and cozy.. a true snuggle bug who could spend hours cuddling and soaking up belly rubs (her all-time favorite activity!). When she gets a burst of energy, she loves playing with her squeaky toys, throwing them up in the air, and showing off her playful side. On walks, she tends to get the attention of passerby’s with her adorable face and frequent head tilts. She’s a wonderful apartment dog who is respectful, mostly quiet, and happiest when she’s close to her people. She’s also getting into a good potty routine, typically going in the morning and improving every day as she adjusts to her schedule. She even enjoys her paws being cleaned with her doggy wipes when she gets back into the apartment (she treats it like she’s at the spa!). Apple is the perfect mix of affectionate, mellow, and curious, and will make an awesome companion in her forever home!"" Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. TOLERANCE TO CITY City pup – Seems unfazed by the sights and sounds, may as well have been born here. POTTY TRAINING Yes – Few or no accidents COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS In between bean – Fine with meeting new people but not particularly interested, kind of shy in busy social situations like a gathering or a packed day in the park. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Yes for most ages – very confident, gentle, low energy, tolerant, not mouthy SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Yes – Good with most other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines *** she will pull towards some other dogs because she wants to say hi but is very easy to redirect and keep walking. She can also be unfazed as well. We have only allowed her to socialize in very quick on-the-go interactions but seems good with other dogs. Used to live with other dogs - okay to be in a home with another dog :) RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc.) Okay to be in a home with cats - we don't forsee this being an issue and she came from a home with cats MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Past this stage– Little to no interest in chewing on stuff or putting things in their mouth that aren’t food. Doesn’t try to chew on hands, feet, etc. during playtime SEPARATION ANXIETY (Please leave your foster dog home alone every day for at least 20 minutes.) Past this stage – Completely fine being left home alone. Doesn’t cry or exhibit destructive behavior when you leave the apartment or house. LEASH MANNERS Getting the hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in their life but figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. CUDDLE BUG LEVEL High – Wants to be in your lap pretty much all the time JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Calm Greetings – Doesn’t jump up on people or dogs. Always all four on the floor. CRATE TRAINING Yep/mostly – Seems comfortable in the crate, may whine a little at first but settles pretty quickly. We use the crate when we leave the pup alone and/or at night. *** we left her in the crate when we were at work for the first few days and she would walk into it when we pointed at it without using any words. She seems to be used to it and falls asleep but she is very good so we don’t put her in the crate anymore. She sleeps in her dog bed in our room at night, not in the crate. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Recovering from an ear infection - common for the breed mix. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm negative; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Puerto Rico or Southern California. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though! This animal is not at the Social Tees office, all are in foster homes.

Lolo,Adult,Female,American Staffordshire Terrier,"Lolo’s story begins in one of the most heartbreaking places imaginable—an infamous Mississippi dumpsite where unwanted animals are cruelly discarded like trash. It’s a place where hope goes to die… but Lolo survived. Abandoned and left to fend for herself, Lolo defied the odds. She’s since blossomed into the most gentle, affectionate companion you could ask for. Despite what she’s been through, her heart is wide open—ready to trust, ready to love, and ready to begin again. Lolo is: 🐾 Dog- and cat-friendly 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Great with people 🚶‍♀️ Loves easy walks and peaceful adventures 🏡 A perfect fit for both apartment life or a home with a yard. She’s not just looking for a home— she’s looking for someone who sees her past, honors her journey, and welcomes her future with open arms. 💫 Lolo is proof that even the most broken places can produce something beautiful. All dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption.

Ion,Young,Male,Mixed Breed,"He LOVES other people (kids too!) and other dogs. He is curious about cats but hasn’t had much experience with them. He is crate trained, potty trained, knows most commands (sit, lie down, paw, is working on stay), is very food motivated and smart so is super trainable, sleeps through the night, loves playing tug, and loves belly runs. He’ll bring you a shoe as a gift when you arrive home and will play tug with it if you try to take it from him but doesn’t chew or destroy people-objects (just his toys and bones). He eventually just puts the shoe down (or will drop it for a treat!). He’s a cuddly sweet guy! He is pretty mellow during the day but likes a romp in the morning and evening. He is very social and seeks engagement so a home with multiple adults/children and with some greenspace (even a small yard) would be ideal. He is ok in the city, a bit scared of the loud noises and overhead trains, but otherwise fine. He is quite the food scavenger! I think he’d thrive best in the suburbs or upstate. He’s still working on his leash skills—can vacillate between pulling and being a bit resistant but is trainable. He’s also still working on recall and consistently responding to his name. He has a bit of resource guarding around bed and can be a bit jumpy if he’s woken up, so I recommend he not sleep in human’s bed (he sleeps in his crate with the door open) and couch cuddles only once you’ve grown familiar with one another. He loves smelling things and is endless curious about nature. Personality & Characteristics: The Ultimate Cuddle Bug & People Pleaser: Ion is simply the most snuggly and friendly pup you'll ever meet! The moment you sit down, he'll be right there, laying on your lap and gazing at you with the most loving eyes. He adores leaning on people and will even sit on your feet for extra closeness. Whip-Smart & A Training Superstar: We're not exaggerating – Ion is incredibly smart and genuinely the easiest dog to train ever! He's picked up a remarkable number of commands in just a few days, including sit, stay, lay, come, look at me, bed, crate, spin, leave it, paw, and even ""follow"" (he'll politely wait for you to go through doors first!). His food motivation makes learning a breeze! Perfectly Sized Companion: Everyone who meets Ion comments on his ideal size, making him a great fit for various living situations. Energy Matcher Extraordinaire: Ion is a true chameleon when it comes to energy! If you're feeling playful or a little anxious, he'll be ready to join in the fun. But if you're in a calm mood, he's just as happy to roll over for some delightful belly scratches. Quiet & Content: In our apartment, Ion is quite calm, usually a 3-4 on the energy scale, spending most of his day napping, with short bursts of playtime like tug-of-war. He's generally a quiet pup, only barking when it's time for a meal! House Trained & Crate Comfortable: Ion is fully house-trained and crate-trained. He sleeps soundly in his crate by himself. While he's still perfecting being left home alone (he might whine a bit initially but settles quickly), he's always calm and happy upon our return. Food Motivated: Loves treats, which are great for training and managing his mild separation anxiety. Sunbathing & Snuggles: His favorite things include soaking up the sun and getting lots of cuddles. Loves Kids: This sweet pup absolutely adores children and is always eager to say hello! Good with Dogs (with a caveat): He's successfully lived with four other dogs and isn't reactive on walks. However, he's a bit selective with his canine companions and may do best as the only dog or with a calm, tolerant buddy after a slow introduction. Low to Medium Shed: Easy to keep clean, with less shedding in cooler weather. Dream Home: Ion will thrive with a family who can shower him with cuddles and continue to reinforce his already impressive training with gentle reminders as he settles in. See More of Ion!

Benito,Young,Male,Labrador Retriever/Staffordshire Bull Terrier,"Meet Benito When we first saw Benito at the Queens NYCACC we knew this quiet but soulful boy would have a very slim chance of adoption. A true underdog, he had double cherry eye, a black coat, and a “bigger” dog. After putting in the work to be the bestest boy he can be, Benito is finally ready for his big debut. Over the many weeks with his foster, they’ve worked together on invaluable skills and he’s taken to them like a natural. Benito has shown us his spunky and social personality - he’s a lover of fetch, friendly with people, and now able to coexist with dogs his size. Benito would make an excellent addition in an adult only home as a solo pet. The perfect family lifestyle would be an active one filled with walks, hikes, playing fetch, and guardians willing to continue with his training. Daily socialization with dogs that match him well would be integral to reinforce his amazing progress. Another example of “it takes a village,” we cannot thank the fosters that have helped him reach this milestone in his journey. This happy, healthy, glowing young pup is ready for his second chance! If you’re interested in fostering or adopting, reach out to us or submit an application via the link in our bio. Benito’s adoption fee is $300 and to show how dedicated we are to his success, we will continue to support his ongoing training.",Large,,Not Sure,Not Sure,Not Sure,Not Sure,Not Sure,,66,https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/petstablished-app-beta/uploads/image/image/5551957/IMG_20251124_183048.heic,,https://www.wagtopia.com/search/pet?id=2481061

Sun,Young,Male,Old English Sheepdog,"Meet Sun | Apply Here | Videos This wonder pup is a 3 year old Old English Sheepdog and weighs 55lbs. His floof of a coat blows in the wind like a real life Fabio and his body still has the floppiness of a puppy. During one of our spay and neuter clinics at our facility in Bundang, a local shelter brought Sun in to get neutered. As soon as our rescue manager saw him, she insisted we take him and help his journey. With personal experience with the breed, she knew how lovely this uncommon pup was, and how low his chance of adoption would be with his size. Now in foster care, Sun is continuing to find himself and grow in many ways. On walks, he is beauty and grace and captivates the attention of many as he holds his nose up to the wind. He’s getting better at his leash walking manners by the day; though he is easily distracted, his quick-to-learn nature is helping him learn that engagement is key! Inside, he’s a walking and breathing shag rug, often sprawled out on the bare floors and splooting in good form. He enjoys chewing and playing with toys, sniffing anything he can get his nose on, and more than anything taking a good nap. Sun is looking for an adult-only household , ideally outside of Manhattan , where he can continue to thrive and grow. This handsome guy is waiting for his happily ever after—once you’ve got your sheep in a row, submit your application and come meet him at the adoption event!
