Elvis,33 Months,Male,Mixed Breed (Small),"Elvis has come a long way. When he first arrived, he was extremely fearful and unsure of the world around him.

Kirsten,37 Months,Female,Mixed Breed (Medium)/None,"Sweet Kirsten has traveled a long way from Tennessee in search of a quiet, patient forever home where she can truly feel safe and loved. This little girl has a gentle soul and a heart full of potential—she’s just waiting for the right person (and dog) to help her shine.  Kirsten is very shy and nervous around new people and unfamiliar environments. But don’t let that stop you from meeting her—because once she feels secure, especially in the company of another well-matched, confident dog, her personality begins to blossom. In fact, she thrives when she has a calm canine companion to show her the ropes and help her feel at ease.  She’s not the type of pup to jump into your arms on day one, but if you’re the kind of person who understands the beauty of slow trust and quiet milestones, Kirsten might just be your perfect match. Every tail wag, every curious glance, every moment of bravery—those are her love letters to you.  Kirsten would do best in a peaceful home with another friendly dog and adults who understand how to give her the space and time she needs to come out of her shell.  If you believe in second chances, gentle patience, and the magic of watching a scared dog learn to feel safe, Kirsten is ready to start that journey—with you.
