Relish,a year,Male,Unknown,"Relish is a sweet, sensitive boy with a big heart who's still learning that the world isn’t such a scary place.  Unfamiliar people and loud noises make him nervous—but don’t let that fool you. Beneath that cautious exterior is a playful, loving, affectionate dog just waiting to shine.
He’s making steady progress in building his confidence every day and just needs someone willing to let him go at his own pace.. What helps most? Other dogs! Relish adores canine companions and really comes alive when around doggie friends. He gains so much comfort and courage from having a friendly dog by his side. He also lights up during a game of fetch—it’s his favorite way to bond and burn off energy.
Relish would do best in a calm, patient home with people who understand that trust takes time.
If you’re the kind of person who believes in giving shy dogs a chance to blossom, Relish is ready to reward your patience with a lifetime of love and loyalty.

Muffin came to Muddy Paws Rescue thru NYCACC after being rescued from a hoarding situation in Brooklyn. But despite her difficult start to life, Muffin has been a brave girl and opened up so much with her fosters. Muffin's favorite thing in the whole world is other dogs. She loves to play with them, snooze near them, and follow them around. Muffin would do best in a home with at least one confident resident dog. She looks to other dogs to show her how to trust humans and during her five months at Muddy Paws Muffin has gone from cowering and refusing to leave her crate to a social happy girl. She greets her humans at the door with a smile and little grunts of joy every time. She potty trained herself and doesn't make a peep inside - we've never heard her bark ever. She needs more time still to fully open up to humans but she'll happily take treats from your hands and has even started allowing butt scritches and pets. All Muffin really wants and needs is a soft clean place to lay, good food to eat, and a canine friend or two. After all Muffin has been through and the bravery she has shown, she deserves her forever home. Could you be it for her?

Sugar,8 years,Female,"Shepherd, Australian","Meet Sugar – a sweet soul with a spunky spirit and a heart full of love

Don’t let my name fool you- I’m more than just sweet. I’m spunky, curious, and full of personality. At 8 years young, I still have plenty of pep in my step for walks, outdoor exploring, and playtime with my favorite humans.

I was born deaf, so I experience the world a little differently, but that doesn’t slow me down one bit. I’m learning sign language (how cool is that?!) and doing great with it, though my foster mom is also teaching me touch signals. What helps me thrive is a calm, structured home with a predictable routine and people who understand that I feel safest when things are steady.

I can get a bit anxious when there’s too much change, but once I know what to expect, I settle right in and show my loving, loyal side. I adore being close to my people- whether it’s curling up on the couch, joining a little adventure, or simply being your shadow.

I’m currently being fostered with both dogs and cats, and I get along beautifully with everyone. I’ve also been around kids and am gentle and patient with them- especially when they offer belly rubs or treats!

And here’s a fun fact: after eight years apart, I was reunited with my birth sister in foster care!

I may not hear when you call me a good girl, but I feel it in my heart every time you show me love. If you’re looking for a gentle, affectionate companion who thrives on routine and will be your loyal best friend through it all, I think we might be the perfect match.

Swiper,2 years,Male,Unknown,"Swiper is a very timid little boy that needs a human that is willing to be incredibly patient with him. He can open up given enough time and some furry friends who can show him how to dog. He is still fearful around people right now but has turned into a little cuddle bug with his foster mom and makes a little bit more progress each day. He takes awhile to warm up to new environments and likes to spend a lot of his time in his crate at first, but he'll slowly start exploring and engaging if given his own space to do so. He loves playing and engaging with other dogs (as long as they're close to his size), and he gains confidence from being able to mirror their behavior and learn how to interact with the world, so he would really love a sibling similar in size to himself.

Swiper is still fearful of most humans and will run away or retreat to his crate if they try to pet him, speak to him, or make eye contact. However, over time he's gotten attached to his foster mom and proven that he can be very affectionate, cuddly, and loving with humans if interactions are slow and on his terms.

He's smart and really knows what's going on! A very quick learner. Charles will walk up and sniff down anything new. Walking with him is like a scavenger hunt; he'll surely show you where the good spots are.
