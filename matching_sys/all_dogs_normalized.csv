These little ones survived thanks to the compassion of a local woman who wouldn't give up on them.

When their mama showed up and gave birth near the woman’s food stand, she kept a close eye on the pups. Mama eventually retreated into the brush to give birth to her last puppy, Tainy, but the woman didn’t know at the time if mama would return. With darkness approaching, the woman didn’t want to leave the puppies alone—so she took them in, keeping them beside her day and night. While she ran her food stand by day, the woman was a cab driver at night. And guess who came along? The woman lovingly bottle fed each of the puppies in between fares, making sure they received enough nutrition to continue growing big and strong.

Eventually, mama returned to the food stand with Tainy to reunite with the rest of her pups. The woman took the whole little family in to keep them safe, and we welcomed these survivors to NYC.

This sweet shepherd mix was likely used for breeding—she was seen in a home with a male dog before being abandoned in a nearby parking lot, extremely skinny, anxious, and with signs of having recently given birth. A Good Samaritan found her and tried to return her to the suspected owners, but they refused to answer the door. 

When Gina arrived at Animal Haven, it quickly became clear that something was different about her: She would begin spinning in circles, sometimes snapping at the air in the process. Initially, we thought this might be a neurological problem and consulted with a specialist to conduct an MRI and spinal tap, but the results did not reveal any neurological or medical issues. We then consulted with a veterinary behaviorist, who suspects that Gina’s spinning episodes are caused primarily by environmental triggers. 

Gina now has a long-term plan to help reduce her stress, manage her environment, and provide her with enrichment and decompression time to hopefully reduce her spinning and air-snapping episodes, but this will be a journey. Her adopter will need to be willing to work with Gina and our trainers to manage her environment and continue her regimen. 

While Gina is definitely a project who will do best with an experienced adopter, we can say with certainty that she is a total sweetheart! She’s snuggly, playful, and responsive to treats and toys. Her episodes typically happen when she is loose in a space, whether her kennel or one of our training rooms, and she can be “snapped out” of them fairly easily. Animal Haven will of course provide ongoing support to help Gina transition and settle into her new home and life.

This terrified boy was trembling when he was caught by police who brought him to a municipal shelter. It's hard to say what his life was before he was found, but he's clearly been through a lot. He was completely shut down when he first arrived at Animal Haven - he trembled in the corner and wouldn’t even take treats tossed near him. But our dedicated staff have been working with him every day to earn his trust and we’re so happy to report that their work has clearly paid off.

Mario has become fast friends with many of our staff and volunteers and has really come out of his shell, but he will need a patient and understanding family who’s willing to work at his pace to build his confidence and set him up for success. He is still a little bit nervous on walks if there is a lot of foot traffic, so he would likely do best in a quieter neighborhood. Mario has shown no aggression during his time with us, favoring avoidance if he’s ever uncomfortable in any situation. Overall, he is a gentle soul who just needs a little extra time to settle in to a new space.

He’s a big guy, but tries to be small whenever he can. We know this sweet boy has a big heart to match and will make an amazing companion for someone willing to put in a little time for him.

Although his rescuers initially thought he had been hit by a car, upon further inspection his injuries were actually fairly old. They believe that he was likely attacked by other dogs on the island, leaving him with partial paralysis in his hindquarters.

Thanks to the amazing Dogs and Cats of Antigua, Douglas has made his way up to Animal Haven where his new life begins. We are so thankful to have the opportunity to give this sweet boy the chance at life he otherwise would not have had.

Right now we are still learning more about Douglas's current condition and we don't have a lot of answers just yet. We are sending him to our partner vets for spinal x-rays and a neurological consultation to get a better idea of the extent of his paralysis. Once we have more information, we'll be able to determine if he's a candidate for corrective surgery or wheelchair! We'll keep you all updated along his journey but he is available for adoption right now! Animal Haven will of course be covering the costs of his diagnostics and treatments and we're hopeful Douglas will charm his way into someone's heart soon.

In addition to his paralysis, Douglas is also suffering from heartworm, ehrlichia, a urinary tract infection, and open lesions on his legs - we know, he's got a LOT going on.

Sweet Cherie is looking for a family and she knows that you're thinking, ""I'm gonna make-a you mineee!""  She's a young and active staffie mix looking to be your one and only pup. She's super affectionate, big on hugs, and absolutely loves bringing her toys with her everywhere she goes.

A good Samaritan saw this poor girl being abandoned and immediately scooped her up out of harm's way. She's now safe and sound at Animal Haven and waiting for another chance to love again. 

Cherie has been in a few fosters during her time at Animal Haven and has done amazing on all of her outings away from the shelter.

Here are some notes from her last foster: 
Cherie is a sweet and well-behaved girl in a home, especially once she has a few days to settle into a new routine - she was accident free in just a few days! She's respectful of human belongings, both when you're home and when you're not.  She's affectionate, cuddly, and loves being right by your side whenever you're home! Cherie is a young and active girl who loves to play, but settles in her bed or on the couch when you leave and will wait for you to get home. 

Cherie gets incredibly excited for walks - she's ready to go whenever! Her toys are great to keep her focused and helps keep her energy directed where it needs to be. She has come a long way since she's been with us, but is still working on her leash manners. She doesn't like to say hi to other dogs, but as long as they don't bark at her, she's been learning to mind her own business.

She is a sweet and active companion and also a good jogging partner! She'll appreciate it as she has lots of energy! Cherie will likely never be a dog park kind of dog, although she has played with some other dogs in the past, she can be a lot for other dogs if they can't match her energy.

Cherie is hoping she'll be able to find a new family of her very own and we know there's someone out there looking for an active, smart-cookie like her! Come meet Cherie at Animal Haven!",Adult,https://animalhaven.org/adopt/dogs/52927830-cherie?hsLang=en,,56.0,Medium,Medium,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

This condition varies in severity on a case by case basis with all dogs and we look to our vets directly on recommendations for his care. Essentially, Monte's esophagus is enlarged and doesn't function correctly to help keep his food down. Monte must sit in a special chair that keeps him upright in order to prevent him from regurgitating his food and he needs to stay upright after feedings for 10-15 minutes to ensure the food safely reaches his stomach. Monte has his own custom ""Bailey Chair"" and uses it like an absolute pro - he hops right into it when it's meal time! His chair will come with him when he's adopted!

Monte is a gleeful, playful dog who otherwise lives a normal life. He LOVES toys and enjoys his ""party time"" in our training room where he runs out his zoomies. Although his condition prevents us from using treats to train, he's highly toy motivated and has been picking up basics like a pro! We've also been utilizing special treats just for dogs with his condition which he loves! Potential adopters will need to be aware that Monte is on a special diet for his condition and currently has 3 meal times a day. If he accidentally ingests anything between those mealtimes, he will need to sit in his chair. He's a big boy that will need consistent, unique training and supervision while he works on his impulse control!

Unfortunately, Monte has spent the majority of his life in a shelter environment during the pandemic, Monte is a little behind in his socialization. He can be unsure about meeting new people and will bark at things he is apprehensive about. He is great with those who he has been properly introduced to though and good introductions will be key! Monte would likely do best in a quieter neighborhood out of Manhattan, away from any enticing sidewalk snacks he shouldn't get into and scary skateboarders.

She was found in a box along with two other puppies, one of which had sadly passed away. She ended up with a family who was ultimately not able to care for her, and made her way to Animal Haven for a third chance.

Stevie is a social gal who loves human attention and has been interested in the dogs she’s met at the shelter so far. She has exuberant puppy energy and is understandably a bit anxious, given everything she’s gone through. With stability, patience, and lots of love, we think Stevie will blossom into a much more confident dog and a loving companion!

Don’t let my name fool you- I’m more than just sweet. I’m spunky, curious, and full of personality. At 8 years young, I still have plenty of pep in my step for walks, outdoor exploring, and playtime with my favorite humans.

I was born deaf, so I experience the world a little differently, but that doesn’t slow me down one bit. I’m learning sign language (how cool is that?!) and doing great with it, though my foster mom is also teaching me touch signals. What helps me thrive is a calm, structured home with a predictable routine and people who understand that I feel safest when things are steady.

I can get a bit anxious when there’s too much change, but once I know what to expect, I settle right in and show my loving, loyal side. I adore being close to my people- whether it’s curling up on the couch, joining a little adventure, or simply being your shadow.

I’m currently being fostered with both dogs and cats, and I get along beautifully with everyone. I’ve also been around kids and am gentle and patient with them- especially when they offer belly rubs or treats!

And here’s a fun fact: after eight years apart, I was reunited with my birth sister in foster care!

He can open up given enough time and some furry friends who can show him how to dog. He is still fearful around people right now but has turned into a little cuddle bug with his foster mom and makes a little bit more progress each day. He takes awhile to warm up to new environments and likes to spend a lot of his time in his crate at first, but he'll slowly start exploring and engaging if given his own space to do so. He loves playing and engaging with other dogs (as long as they're close to his size), and he gains confidence from being able to mirror their behavior and learn how to interact with the world, so he would really love a sibling similar in size to himself.

Swiper is still fearful of most humans and will run away or retreat to his crate if they try to pet him, speak to him, or make eye contact. However, over time he's gotten attached to his foster mom and proven that he can be very affectionate, cuddly, and loving with humans if interactions are slow and on his terms.

Max is a small, sweet pup with a big personality and an even bigger heart. He has some mild vision impairment, but it doesn’t slow him down—he navigates his world with confidence, curiosity, and plenty of enthusiasm. Max is very good in his crate, sleeps soundly through the night, and is doing well on housebreaking when kept on a schedule. He currently lives with two dogs and gets along beautifully with them. He will do well in a home with another calm, friendly dog who can help show him the ropes. Max LOVES toys and has the funniest way of inviting you to play—complete with silly noises and bouncy little hops. He’s also a big fan of walks and enjoys frolicking around the yard, and loves to take rides.

Zz Bella And Roscoe-Courtesy Listing,Labrador Retriever,Female,https://ny-petrescue.org/files/eShop/bellaroscoe.jpg,https://www.cognitoforms.com/PetRescue2/PetRescueDogApplication,"A little About ZZ Bella and Roscoe-Courtesy Listing...
We would love these two dogs to find a forever home together, but it is not absolutely necessary.
Bella and Roscoe are a beautiful brother–sister duo who have grown up together and share a truly special bond. They’re both incredibly sweet, affectionate dogs who want nothing more than a safe, loving home where they can be part of the family. Both pups had a full vet check-up and updated vaccines on 11/18/25 They’re healthy, up-to-date, and have no medical issues. They are gentle, friendly, and have never shown any aggression  toward people. They both did a 16 hour road trip without any complications, no barking, no whining, and no climbing.
Bella is a total sweetheart with a huge heart and even bigger personality. She loves pets, neck scratches, and belly rubs — and she’ll happily melt right into you for attention. She has a playful, energetic side outdoors, but she settles nicely once inside and loves relaxing with her humans. Bella can get excited and may jump up to greet you, but it’s all love and enthusiasm. She enjoys fetch, chew toys, and exploring new scents. She’s great with other dogs — always eager to say hello — and if another dog gets too pushy, she’ll simply bark to communicate. She’s been doing wonderfully on a leash. She gets curious and may stop to sniff, but listens well when you encourage her to keep moving. She has not had any accidents inside the house and has been responding very well to a walking routine. An angel in the car. 

Roscoe is our gentle giant — a big, lovable teddy bear who just wants someone to be near. He’s more low-key than Bella but still enjoys playtime, cuddles, and belly rubs (his absolute favorite). He’s curious about other dogs and may pause to look, but he doesn’t pull. If another dog becomes aggressive, he’ll give a bark, but overall he’s calm and easygoing. Because of his size and his early inexperience with walks, he’s currently using a prong collar for guidance — and he has made huge progress. Initially Roscoe was hesitant to get moving, but now, with a gentle correction, he happily follows along and often walks right at your side. If pulled too firmly, he may flop over for attention instead — he’s truly a softie at heart. He's an angel in the car.

Meet Finn.  He became homeless when his owner recently passed away. Finn is an awesome 2yr old German Shepherd. True to his breed, he is smart and loyal. He was well bred and has great structure and hips.  He responds well to ALL spoken commands, is housebroken, and takes food gently. He is excellent in the house  and quietly follows you around.  Finn is neutered, up to date on vaccines, walks very well on the leash and does 'his business quickly once outside. Finn  prefers spending time with his person and would do best with a quiet home with lots of love. Finn enjoys bird watching but is definitely a squirrel chaser. Finn would benefit from a place to run (a large fenced yard would be great) and an active lifestyle, although he is capable of being a couch potato as well. He is young and deserves a forever home to call his own.  This young handsome boy needs a forever home asap, as his foster family will be traveling at the end of October!  If interested please contact 646-207-6966 or ldellatte@hotmail.com",Adult,https://ny-petrescue.org//Adopt-Dogs/details/2981/ZZ-Finn-Courtesy-Listing,True,55.0,Medium,Medium,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

She’s demonstrated remarkable resilience and despite requiring leg amputation. she moves effortlessly, including navigating stairs. In a previous foster setting, she harmoniously coexisted with smaller dogs and a cat. However, she’s selective about canine companions and cautious around children.  Now a year and 1/2 old, fully vaccinated, spayed, and weighing 40 pounds, she’s eager for a loving environment. Basic training and housebreaking is complete, and additional training will be paid for. Flower is most likely full size, and ever so ready to provide affection and loyalty. A key aspect of her personality is her love for cuddling. A true testament about this sweet pooch from her rescuer; “I want so badly to get this sweet girl to a great home. She is very special.” Flower is in Sleepy Hollow and ready to meet you. learn more or arrange a meeting, please only contact Pia at  914-505-0532  or drpiasalk@gmail.com",Adult,https://ny-petrescue.org//Adopt-Dogs/details/2328/ZZ-Flower-Courtesy-Listing,,40.0,Medium,Medium,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60 walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably! Adults usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. A consistent walking route and schedule plus finding spots with grass or dirt can help. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some like to wrestle with every passing pup, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Not sure yet! Some breed mixes that are generally NOT great matches for homes with cats include large hounds, huskies, and shepherds. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico ; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

He ended up in the shelter a few times because his owner could not take care of him, but he was always eventually reclaimed. When his owner was evicted in September, Wilson and his feline sibling were left behind, trapped in their apartment. Thankfully they were rescued, but for Wilson it was the start of a difficult few months. Back in the city shelter once again, Wilson slowly started to shut down, becoming more anxious everyday, eventually refusing to go on walks, interact with staff and barely eating. In November, Wilson was moved to the euthanasia list and his time was running out. Thankfully, at the last minute a kind hearted foster came forward and agreed to take in this gentle giant so we were able to welcome him to our rescue. Wilson was a little nervous at all the changes, but after a few days of love and attention in a home with 2 cats and a small dog, Wilson relaxed and showed us what an amazing addition to any family he would. Wilson is a happy, playful guy who adores spending time with his people. He doesn’t need to sleep in the bed with you but he would love to curl up in a dog bed right beside you at night. He doesn’t need to be entertained when you want a quiet evening but he would love to snuggle on the couch with you. He doesn’t need you to take him hiking every weekend but he would love a game of fetch at the park. Wilson is cat, dog and kid friendly, but he is a big boy who will need a playdate with dogs and kids before deciding if he is the right match for you. Wilson had some issues with his teeth when he first came to us but has had a full dental and is now in much better shape. He does have some teeth missing and would do well with softer food and treats.

Tyler loves to spend time outside and would be delighted to have access to a garden for sunbathing. Tyler is happy to be around other dogs as long as they are a similar energy level to him - buddy’s who like to nap! He is not looking for a playmate and prefers to be left to his own devices. Tyler loves car rides but is also quite happy to stay at home and has no seperation anxiety. Similarly, Tyler will be ok around cats who leave him alone, but will bark if they come too close. Tyler enjoys spending time with his human family, he is the most adorable compainion, but he can get nervous around strangers. Due to his age, Tyler would do best in an adult only home or with older children. Tyler has the early signs of canine dementia, so he needs someone willing to keep an eye on him if he starts to become confused or anxious. He needs someone who understands it will take him a while to understand new situations and will be patient when he needs time to adjust.

This sweet, handsome boy was on the list to be euthanized and we were fortunate enough to save him minutes before it was too late . Surrendered through no fault of his own, King Jimmy was deeply loved by his previous family, who made the difficult decision to rehome him after moving in to care for elderly parents. This loyal boy has known nothing but love and kindness and is now hoping to find his next forever home—one where he can once again be someone’s best friend, hiking buddy, and devoted shadow. King aka Jimmy is the perfect blend of playful and chill. He's housebroken, crate trained, and knows all his basic commands—including “sit,” “stay,” “wait,” and “leave it.” He’s got great leash manners, walking at a calm, easy pace with only the occasional tug when something especially exciting (like a stray cat!) crosses his path. He’s easily redirected with a gentle voice or treat and always eager to please. Speaking of treats, he loves them :) Jimmy’s previous owner stated that he was attacked by two dogs before coming into the shelter (see his adorably wonky ear). He’s been getting along great with the dogs he’s met in foster, but if you have another dog a meet and greet is required to make sure it’s a good match. Jimmy loves to play with his toys and would be great with older kids. He would make a wonderful addition to a lucky family To see Jimmy's full profile with more pictures, please visit wagtopia.com",Adult,https://www.wagtopia.com/search/pet?id=2396060,True,53.0,Unknown,Unknown,True,True,True

Originally rehomed by his first owner, Rocky was then surrendered by his second family after just three months, through no fault of his own. Despite the instability in his life, Rocky remains a sweet, wiggly boy who greets everyone with a wagging tail and a heart full of love. Rocky is the definition of a social butterfly—he's incredibly people-friendly, happily nuzzling into volunteers and seeking out affection wherever he goes. He allows all-over handling, even during medical care, and has proven himself to be both gentle and trusting as he heals from some minor wounds. Though he can be a little snatchy with treats, he's food-motivated and easy to redirect. On walks, Rocky pulls only slightly and enjoys sniffing and exploring. He loves being outside and is eager to get out of his kennel, though he sometimes needs a little coaxing to go back in. In playgroups, Rocky has shown some curiosity about other dogs but tends to be more of an observer, keeping his distance and sniffing around the yard rather than engaging in direct play. He’s also lived with cats in his previous home and reportedly got along well with them. Whether you’re looking for a loyal companion to share quiet walks, cuddle sessions, or just some relaxed company, Rocky could be your guy.

He REALLY loves other dogs and would do really well in a home with another pup :) This puppy is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Thier Foster Parent Says: ""Charlie is an incredibly sweet, loving, funny guy. He loves to play with toys and other dogs, and, like most young dogs his age, likes to pass out after he's exhausted himself from playtime. He also loves to snuggle when he's tired, resting his head on your shoulder while he nestles. He is VERY scared of loud or new noises so he does need help shifting energy when he gets startled like that. Sometimes he barks and does a low-level growl when he hears those unfamiliar noises but he is never aggressive towards others. The only time he really barks is if someone is approaching the house to alert us but then quickly goes to hide if someone new comes inside. He can get a little scared and hide but, as he gets more and more acclimated, he comes out to explore his surroundings. It's very important to instill in him that he is safe and cared for at all times. Once he has decided you are a safe person, he will be your shadow! He's very playful and likes to jump up and sometimes will accidentally scratch but it's never on purpose-he just loves to have fun! He gets up around 7:00 am to go outside and have breakfast and then sometimes will even go back to sleep. Then he likes to play with other dogs (we have 2 others in the house) before taking a nap. We go for walks with Charlie to improve his leash etiquette-he's VERY eager to walk but is still learning how to walk better on the leash! Then we'll have dinner around 6:00 pm with him, he'll do some more romping, and he'll go to bed with us. He is very good about bedtime routine. Once the lights are off he goes to sleep and loves to cuddle up at the end of the bed. Overall, Charlie has been a real joy to have and to take care of. Anyone would be lucky to have him!"" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Cuddle Bug Level-high Comfy with strangers?- Fine with meeting new people but not particularly interested, kind of shy in busy social situations like a gathering or a packed day in the park. Once he is inside he will shower them with kisses. He just needs to be in his safe space. Good with Children? (ALWAYS requires supervision)- Yes for 12 and up -- may be a little energetic or a little skittish, best with older children that can be extra gentle or that are big enough not to get accidentally knocked down Good with Other Dogs?- Yes -- Good with all other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines Mouthy Behavior?- Is either still in the puppy stage or was never trained to not be mouthy. Wants to put everything in their mouth. Tries to chew on your hands when playing or needs attention, grabs the leash with its mouth, loves to gnaw on your personal belongings. He is easily corrected with a toy. Leash Manners?- Getting the Hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in its life but he is figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. Okay in the city? Sort of -- Spooked easily by loud noises and bustling areas but walks pretty well and probably just needs more time to adjust (may be a puppy or a brand new rescue) Jumping on People to Say Hi?- Medium – Jumps up only on people the dog knows when really excited. Stops with correction. Separation Anxiety? -Low – Completely fine being left home alone. Doesn’t cry or do anything shitty when you leave the apartment or house. Crate training? -Yep/mostly – Seems comfortable in the crate, may whine a little at first but settles pretty quickly. We use the crate when we leave the pup alone and/or at night Medical status: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee or St. Thomas. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Their Foster Parent Says: "" Steve loves people and dogs and chasing after squirrels and birds. Every time we pass a person or a dog, he is always wagging his tail and pulling his leash to greet them. As soon as someone gives him affection, he literally slides down and rolls over on his back for belly rubs. He is such a trusting and sweet dog. In the morning, he waits patiently for me in the bathroom while I get ready and will sit or lay down on my bath mat (since I have towels everywhere on the floor to protect my white carpets, he thinks any towel is for him) then we go for a 45 minute walk, come home and he eats his breakfast, depending on how tired he is from his walk, he will typically play on his own for an hour before taking a 4 hour nap. We then go for a potty break, play a little more and then another 45 minute walk in the evening followed by dinner, more play time and a final night potty. He is definitely teething right now and is a little mouthy which is understandable for a pup his age. He loves playing fetch, gnawing on his toys and is very food motivated. As a typical lab, he scarfs down his food in 5 minutes even with a slow feeder. He needs leash training as he pulls very hard during our walks when he sees a bird, squirrel or dog which is often as you can imagine in NYC. He is a little afraid of bikes, buses and leaf blowers and will pull the leash to move away from them and gets down low. However he is pretty tolerable of the city life and will adjust quickly. He’s very comfortable in elevators, with stairs and riding the subway which is impressive coming from South Carolina. The best part about this pup, is he practically came potty trained and crate trained and has had no accidents thus far! The best pup of the 7 I’ve fostered thus far."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60-90 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) City pup Seems unfazed by the sights and sounds, may as well have been born here. POTTY TRAINING Yes – Few or no accidents COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS Social butterfly – Wants to be friends with everyone who walks by, loves anyone who will stop to say hello. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Maybe for age 12 and up – Is either big and energetic (okay with kids big enough not to get knocked down) or a little skittish (could be comfortable with older children that can be extra gentle) SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Yes – Good with most other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc. Not sure – Wants to chase squirrels and birds so may not be a good match for a home with cats, rabbits, etc. MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Needs training – Is either still in the puppy stage or was never trained. Tries to put their mouth on your hands when playing or needs attention, grabs leash, chews on your personal belongings SEPARATION ANXIETY ( Adjusting – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone otherwise. LEASH MANNERS WTF is a leash – Pulls hard. Zig zags like crazy. Has no idea how to walk on a leash or doesn’t have outside privileges yet (too young) CUDDLE BUG LEVEL Medium – Likes to snuggle when he's in the mood but often stays in his own bed JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Needs training – Very excited to greet everyone and has no idea how to do so politely. Jumps up on most strangers or other dogs that go by. In puppy phase or wasn’t trained as a young adult. CRATE TRAINING Yep/mostly – Seems comfortable in the crate, may whine a little at first but settles pretty quickly. We use the crate when we leave the pup alone and/or at night. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico ; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico.

Tragically, her rescuer passed away not long after saving her. 💔 Through heartbreak and loss, one thing remained clear — Princess meant the world to him, and he wanted her to have a happy life. After his passing, a compassionate neighbor stepped in to make sure Princess wouldn’t end up back on the streets. She’s been caring for her and reaching out for help to find the forever home her rescuer always dreamed of for her. Princess is everything her name promises — gentle, loyal, affectionate, and eager to please.

Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60-90 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably! Adults usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. A consistent walking route and schedule plus finding spots with grass or dirt can help. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some like to wrestle with every passing pup, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Not sure yet! Some breed mixes that are generally NOT great matches for homes with cats include large hounds, huskies, and shepherds. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet.

Our Team Says: ""Lissa is a very easy, chill and well behaved dog to have around. A perfect buddy. She would do best in a calm part of the city - BK, Queens or the calm areas near Central Park. She'd be beyond thrilled to live in the burbs. She's very trusting of women but takes some time to warm up to men, so they need to be extra gentle and patient with her."" Thier Foster Parent Says: "" Lissa is such a sweet girl. She loves attention - pets, belly rubs, even just talking to her. She loves to play fetch in the house with her stuffed toys and especially the tennis ball. She likes to play bite but is super gentle and listens when told to be nice or to stop. She knows sit, down, paw, other paw, and two paws (two paws meet two hands) - loves treats so can only do so many of those tricks before she gets too excited. Lissa loves to be outside and sniff but can be wary of noisier streets. Garbage trucks and mopeds/motorcycles seem to bother her the most. I think she would love a yard, and/or a quiet neighborhood to get longer walks in or near a park. If we go earlier in the morning when it is quiet, she walks very well. Easy to handle on the leash, sometimes just needs a little extra encouragement to keep walking if she gets spooked. Completely potty trained. We go out in the morning before breakfast, 1-2 times during the day, and once more before bedtime. Even though she doesn't walk too much, she's still pretty chill in the apartment. She'll sleep, seek out attention throughout the day to play for a bit and get out some energy, but ultimately hangs on the couch and just likes to be near someone. Loves attention but is just fine left alone - always greets you like you've been gone for ages and it is the sweetest welcome home. I adore her! She is very easy to take care of and is such a lover. Genuinely surprised someone hasn't adopted her yet!"" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: This dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.)

Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: FLEXIBLE: We predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale with regard to exercise and mental stimulation requirements, but seniors tend to need a lot of help and understanding when it comes to lifestyle and veterinary issues. Seniors usually need quiet, calm environments and routines and do not do well with a lot of bustle, change, and rambunctious movement (kids and young playful dogs, for instance). This dog’s adopter will need to be prepared for senior health challenges, which usually come with expensive veterinary bills and time in vet offices. Senior care can also take an emotional toll on their humans. Adopting a mature pup is a wonderful thing to do, but it can also be difficult. Energy level LOWER: Pretty chill indoors and won’t demand endless amounts of stimulation and exercise but still needs a few short walks a day (10-30 min each) for potty breaks and to stretch their legs MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60-90 minute walk in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs socializing opportunities outside the home and a little mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice or chew items. Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most seniors do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably! Seniors usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. Seniors tend to need potty breaks more often than younger dogs though, and they can lose their ability to fully control their potty habits as they continue to age, so willingness to be flexible with cleanup and wee pads if necessary is important. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some enjoy the company of other calm dogs, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Probably. Seniors are usually mellow enough that they are able to coexist well with cats. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake.

Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Our Team Says: Pongo does best in the calmer parts of the city - BK, Queens, etc. Would love a burbs home. Thier Foster Parent Says: “Perfect Pongo” is our nickname for this goofy and cuddly guy. He’s an absolute love bug and can’t get enough of cuddles, especially in the morning when he’s lazy and wants to sleep in. We’ve been working on crate training and he has no aversion to the crate—he’d prefer to sit with you on the couch, but on occasion he has put himself to bed in the crate. He now knows how to “sit” and “come”, both of which are super helpful in walks when the city can become a little overstimulating for this Southern Gentleman. On walks he’s getting better on the leash, although he does love trash bags, probably a survival tactic from his previous days. He’s truly the nicest and kindest dog, with a heart of gold. He’s also incredibly enthusiastic, which can be both good and bad on walks. He loves to play with other dogs, sometimes playing for him is using his big paws to bat at another pup. He can be skittish around loud noises and big trucks. His potty training is going well! He does prefer to pee inside on a puppy pad, but he hasn’t had an accident off the puppy pad since his first day. He is a puppy so he might try to put his mouth around your finger, but he never closes on it. He’s got a soft mouth and the best heart."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) TOLERANCE TO CITY Adjusting to the city – Spooked easily by loud noises and bustling areas but walks pretty well in quiet areas and probably just needs more time to adjust (may be a puppy or a brand new rescue). Would prefer a home in a calmer part of the city or the suburbs. POTTY TRAINING Sort of — On the way and learning! May be using wee pads (is a puppy or a brand new rescue) COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS Social butterfly – Wants to be friends with everyone who walks by, loves anyone who will stop to say hello. (But also a little shy some days) BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Yes for most ages – very confident, gentle, low energy, tolerant, not mouthy (Can get scared when kids are erratic or aggressively patting his head) SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Yes – Good with most other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc.) Not sure – Wants to chase squirrels and birds so may not be a good match for a home with cats, rabbits, etc. MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Needs training – Is either still in the puppy stage or was never trained. Tries to put their mouth on your hands when playing or needs attention, grabs leash, chews on your personal belongings SEPARATION ANXIETY Adjusting – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone otherwise. LEASH MANNERS WTF is a leash – Pulls hard. Zig zags like crazy. Has no idea how to walk on a leash or doesn’t have outside privileges yet (too young) CUDDLE BUG LEVEL High – Wants to be in your lap pretty much all the time JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Listens to correction – Only jumps on people they know when really excited, stops with correction. CRATE TRAINING Yep/mostly – Seems comfortable in the crate, may whine a little at first but settles pretty quickly. We use the crate when we leave the pup alone and/or at night. MEDICAL STATUS: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon HOW DID THIS DOG END UP WITH US? Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

(This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) POTTY TRAINED? Working on this skill. Puppies under 12 weeks old are often on track with their wee pad skills, but they’re too young to walk outside in public NYC areas yet because they haven’t finished their puppy vaccine series. Puppies older than 12 weeks are usually learning to do their business outside. Potty training takes a lot of patience, consistency, and clean up. SOCIAL WITH DOGS? Yes. Some puppies are shy, others are bold, but all have the potential to be taught healthy socializing skills. It’s a huge part of raising a puppy and must be done carefully. How they interact with other dogs depends largely on how their humans help them learn to. SOCIAL WITH CHILDREN? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) Yes… but most puppies are not a great match for a home with kids under age 8 because they go through intense mouthy play and rambunctious phases and often accidentally hurt young kids while playing. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. SOCIAL WITH CATS? Yes. Almost all puppies have the potential to be friends with a cat. It’s on the adopter to know their cat’s temperament and preferences and to teach their puppy respectful manners. MOUTHY PLAY: High! All puppies go through phases where they chew your stuff and grab your hands, arms, feet… puppies naturally explore the world, play, and test boundaries with their mouths. (It also happens when they’re teething.) Their teeth are super sharp though, so it can be a very painful phase for humans and other animals in the home. Proper training, outlets, and socialization are key. SEPARATION ANXIETY MEDIUM: Most puppies have some level of separation anxiety as they learn to self soothe. Often they cry the first 10+ minutes when they are left home alone or in a crate. Consistent training and alone time is crucial. LEASH MANNERS: None. :) Will need to learn this skill. CRATE TRAINED: Nope. None of our new puppies have been formally trained, but many of our foster parents/adopters choose to crate train. It can be a great way to keep puppies safe and teach them independence. MEDICAL STATUS: Healthy as far as we know.

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Our Team Says: ""Lio has missing fur on the bottom half of his body due to living in neglect for a long time. He was rescued with a few other dogs thier hair grew back but his has not and we're not sure if it will - he's seen a vet - good bloodkwork for a senior. Lio also needs a home with another dog - he has seperation anxiety and another dog helps him a ton."" Thier Foster Parent Says: "" Lio has the sweetest, warmest personality and is always eager to please. He loves toys and can happily entertain himself, but he lights up when you join in on the fun. A true cuddle bug, he adores napping nearby and snuggling close. He’s still learning to go potty outside — we’ve been practicing every day by going on walks and letting him explore where other dogs have gone, but he hasn’t quite made the connection yet. He does use pee pads indoors and we’re continuing to work on it with patience and routine. On walks, I’ve already noticed steady improvement with his leash skills — he’s becoming more confident, curious, and comfortable with each outing. He’s been wonderful with other dogs, greeting them gently and respectfully, and while he’s a little shy in busier settings, he warms to people with a little bit of time. Despite being a senior, Lio has great energy — he can match your pace, whether you’re on a Zoom call needing a calm companion or ready for playtime. He's working hard on being home alone - his ideal home has another dog in it - he came from a hoarding situation. Occasionally, he’ll nudge a toy your way, just to see if you’re up for a little play or some extra pet."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: FLEXIBLE: We predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale with regard to exercise and mental stimulation requirements, but seniors tend to need a lot of help and understanding when it comes to lifestyle and veterinary issues. Seniors usually need quiet, calm environments and routines and do not do well with a lot of bustle, change, and rambunctious movement (kids and young playful dogs, for instance). This dog’s adopter will need to be prepared for senior health challenges, which usually come with expensive veterinary bills and time in vet offices. Senior care can also take an emotional toll on their humans. Adopting a mature pup is a wonderful thing to do, but it can also be difficult. TOLERANCE TO CITY City pup – Seems unfazed by the sights and sounds, may as well have been born here. POTTY TRAINING Sort of — On the way and learning! May be using wee pads (is a puppy or a brand new rescue) COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS In between bean – Fine with meeting new people but not particularly interested, kind of shy in busy social situations like a gathering or a packed day in the park. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Yes for most ages – very confident, gentle, low energy, tolerant, not mouthy SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Yes – Good with most other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc.) Not sure – Wants to chase squirrels and birds so may not be a good match for a home with cats, rabbits, etc. Have not really seen him around other animals besides dogs. Does not chase squirrels so far. MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Working on it – Is respectful of hands, feet, etc. but likes to chew on things they’re not supposed to like shoes, furniture, etc. Want to note that this is very minimal and he will stop if you just ask him to. SEPARATION ANXIETY (Please leave your foster dog home alone every day for at least 20 minutes.) Adjusting – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone otherwise. Seems to adjust being left alone a little better out of a crate than in a crate. Slightly anxious. LEASH MANNERS Getting the hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in their life but figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. CUDDLE BUG LEVEL High – Wants to be in your lap pretty much all the time JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Listens to correction – Only jumps on people they know when really excited, stops with correction. CRATE TRAINING Working on it – We set one up and leave the door open but rarely close it because the dog freaks out Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake. Adopters will need to be ready for senior care – at a minimum, that will be annual checkups including senior bloodwork and a dental post adoption (most senior rescues need one).

He is a showstopper on the streets rocking his silky coat and middle part. He is pretty unphased by city life and loves to go for a long walk or accompany you on your errands. He enjoys saying hello to other dogs on the street and will try to jump up and say hi to strangers at times. He is quickly getting the hang of leash walking and does all his business outside- in a day or two he’ll be a pro at the leash. He is extremely affectionate and will climb into your lap gently for cuddles and lick your whole face clean. He loves to be pet, but prefers to find a cozy spot on the carpet or dog bed to nap. At home he will play with his toys on his own or occupy himself with a chew, while keeping a close eye on you. It honestly doesn’t get more perfect than this southern gentleman."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: This dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60-90 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys.

Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably! Adults usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. A consistent walking route and schedule plus finding spots with grass or dirt can help. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some like to wrestle with every passing pup, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Not sure yet! Some breed mixes that are generally NOT great matches for homes with cats include large hounds, huskies, and shepherds. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet.

This dog is eligible to join our foster-to-adopt program. Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Thier Foster Parent Says: ""Currant is a timid, gentle, and incredibly sweet senior dog. During her first few days, she preferred to stay in her crate, quietly observing her new surroundings. With patience, time and some treats, she is trusting and approaching. She enjoys her meal time, hops and follows around while we are preparing her meals. She enjoys short breaks and is looking to run back into her crate once she is done exploring. She did fine when interacting with our two dogs both indoor and outdoor. She’s calm, quiet, and happiest in a peaceful home with minimal disturbances."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: FLEXIBLE: We predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale with regard to exercise and mental stimulation requirements, but seniors tend to need a lot of help and understanding when it comes to lifestyle and veterinary issues. Seniors usually need quiet, calm environments and routines and do not do well with a lot of bustle, change, and rambunctious movement (kids and young playful dogs, for instance). This dog’s adopter will need to be prepared for senior health challenges, which usually come with expensive veterinary bills and time in vet offices. Senior care can also take an emotional toll on their humans. Adopting a mature pup is a wonderful thing to do, but it can also be difficult. Energy level LOWER: Pretty chill indoors and won’t demand endless amounts of stimulation and exercise but still needs a few short walks a day (10-30 min each) for potty breaks and to stretch their legs City Suitability: Would not do well in a busy city. She’s easily spooked by noises and prefers a calm, slow-paced environment. She’d be perfect for someone in the suburbs or countryside. Potty Training: She’s potty trained to go outside during yard breaks but also uses wee pads inside her playpen if needed. Strangers: Shy at first, but very food motivated. Positive reinforcement goes a long way with her — treats help her open up quickly. Other Dogs: She’s okay with calm dogs who keep to themselves after the initial sniff. She’s not playful or social with other dogs and generally prefers her own space. Kids: Okay with respectful adults. Young kids could scare her. Cats: Yes. Seniors are usually mellow enough that they are able to coexist well with cats. Mouthy Behavior: None. She has no interest in chewing or grabbing anything she’s not supposed to. Separation: Fine being left alone. She mostly naps or relaxes quietly. Leash Skills: Not good on leash. She prefers being off-leash in a secure yard and doesn’t enjoy going for walks on a leash. Cuddles: She’s not clingy, but she likes being around people she trusts. Not a lap dog, but will lie nearby. Crate: She uses her crate when she wants quiet time. No issues with crating when needed. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm negative; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake. Adopters will need to be ready for senior care – at a minimum, that will be annual checkups including senior bloodwork and a dental post adoption (most senior rescues need one). How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee or St. Thomas. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Potty trained? Working on this skill. Puppies under 12 weeks old are often on track with their wee pad skills, but they’re too young to walk outside in public NYC areas yet because they haven’t finished their puppy vaccine series. Puppies older than 12 weeks are usually learning to do their business outside. Potty training takes a lot of patience, consistency, and clean up. Social with dogs? Yes. Some puppies are shy, others are bold, but all have the potential to be taught healthy socializing skills. It’s a huge part of raising a puppy and must be done carefully. How they interact with other dogs depends largely on how their humans help them learn to. Social with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) Yes… but most puppies are not a great match for a home with kids under age 8 because they go through intense mouthy play and rambunctious phases and often accidentally hurt young kids while playing. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Social with cats? Yes. Almost all puppies have the potential to be friends with a cat. It’s on the adopter to know their cat’s temperament and preferences and to teach their puppy respectful manners. Mouthy play: High! All puppies go through phases where they chew your stuff and grab your hands, arms, feet… puppies naturally explore the world, play, and test boundaries with their mouths. (It also happens when they’re teething.) Their teeth are super sharp though, so it can be a very painful phase for humans and other animals in the home. Proper training, outlets, and socialization are key. Separation anxiety: MEDIUM: Most puppies have some level of separation anxiety as they learn to self soothe. Often they cry the first 10+ minutes when they are left home alone or in a crate. Consistent training and alone time is crucial. Leash manners: None. :) Will need to learn this skill. Crate trained? Nope. None of our new puppies have been formally trained, but many of our foster parents/adopters choose to crate train. It can be a great way to keep puppies safe and teach them independence. Medical status: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico.

He does great in all kinds of public situations and will accompany you on your walk to the coffee shop or to a fun pet-friendly store! He is very treat-motivated but is polite with his meals and likes to graze throughout the day. Napping in a cozy blanket while watching reality TV is one of his favorite afternoon activities. He is very curious about what the people are up to and will follow to observe you (just in case you're getting a treat). Ted would love a backyard that he can freely explore and hang out in when the weather is nice, but he also loves wandering around the city, so it's not a must. Ted is very patient and doesn't mind when you leave, he will curl up and snooze or stare out the window while you're away.

Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Medical status Ted has pulmonary hypertension - a side effect of being treated for heartworm. Requires daily medication and annual monitoring. He ended up in the ER for a few days a few months ago but has been doing really well on his medication once we were able to find out exactly what was going on! Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm negative; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake. How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Puerto Rico or Southern California. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

Our Team Says: ""Francis needs a home in a calm area. She's not fully a city girl. Calm areas and beyond are best for this girl!"" Thier Foster Parents Says: ""Francis is a sweet, silly and rambunctious gal who is very shy at first but really bursts out of her shell once she’s comfortable. She’s curious about the world around her and is always the first one to investigate new items at home (she is not this brave out in the wild). Fran loves to play hard but loves to nap just as much! Fran loves a good sunbathing moment and will always look for a sunny spot around the house to bask in. She loves going on walks especially with her K9 foster brother (her preferred company), but is very hesitant to do her business in new places, the slower the pace the better. Though she is a very friendly pup, she shies away from strangers out in public, she prefers slow meet and greets. She’s a big cuddle bug, and loves behind the ear scratches. Francis loves following her human around when they're home, on my work from home days she can be found hanging out in my study with her foster brother or napping by my feet while I take a meeting. True to her inner chihuahua nature, this small gal has a small but mighty bark, especially when she gets spooked, she’s not a fan of surprises or loud noises. Fran can be a little stubborn (especially when it involves an early morning wake up) but overall, is a very good girl!"" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Cuddle Bug Level Medium — Likes to snuggle when he's in the mood but often stays in his own bed Potty Trained Sort of — On the way and learning! may be using wee pads (is a puppy or a brand new rescue) Comfy with strangers? Nope — Quite the wallflower, very shy with new people and takes a while to warm up. Afraid when unfamiliar people try to say hi on the street, hides or shrinks back when new people visit the home. Good with Children? (ALWAYS requires supervision) Yes for 12 and up — may be a little energetic or a little skittish, best with older children that can be extra gentle or that are big enough not to get accidentally knocked down Good with Other Dogs? Mostly — Generally good with other dogs but may be picky (scared of big dogs or plays too rough for small dogs, for example) Good with Other Animals? (cats, small pets, etc.) Francis is still too unsure of the world around to notice the birds and squirrels she encounters on her walks. Mouthy Behavior? Low – Little to no interest in chewing on stuff or putting things in its mouth that aren’t food. Doesn’t try to chew on hands, feet, etc. during playtime, doesn’t wreck your stuff — only chews on appropriate things like dog toys and bones. Leash Manners? Getting the Hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in its life but he/she is figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. Okay in the city? Nope — Needs a home out of the city! Jumping on People to Say Hi? Medium – Jumps up only on people the dog knows when really excited. Stops with correction. Separation Anxiety? Medium – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone. Crate training? Not at all – Don’t even have one, I’ve puppy proofed and we free range. Medical status: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee or St. Thomas.

(This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) POTTY TRAINED? Working on this skill. Puppies under 12 weeks old are often on track with their wee pad skills, but they’re too young to walk outside in public NYC areas yet because they haven’t finished their puppy vaccine series. Puppies older than 12 weeks are usually learning to do their business outside. Potty training takes a lot of patience, consistency, and clean up. SOCIAL WITH DOGS? Yes. Some puppies are shy, others are bold, but all have the potential to be taught healthy socializing skills. It’s a huge part of raising a puppy and must be done carefully. How they interact with other dogs depends largely on how their humans help them learn to. SOCIAL WITH CHILDREN? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) Yes… but most puppies are not a great match for a home with kids under age 8 because they go through intense mouthy play and rambunctious phases and often accidentally hurt young kids while playing. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. SOCIAL WITH CATS? Yes. Almost all puppies have the potential to be friends with a cat. It’s on the adopter to know their cat’s temperament and preferences and to teach their puppy respectful manners. MOUTHY PLAY: High! All puppies go through phases where they chew your stuff and grab your hands, arms, feet… puppies naturally explore the world, play, and test boundaries with their mouths. (It also happens when they’re teething.) Their teeth are super sharp though, so it can be a very painful phase for humans and other animals in the home. Proper training, outlets, and socialization are key. SEPARATION ANXIETY MEDIUM: Most puppies have some level of separation anxiety as they learn to self soothe. Often they cry the first 10+ minutes when they are left home alone or in a crate. Consistent training and alone time is crucial. LEASH MANNERS: None. :) Will need to learn this skill. CRATE TRAINED: Nope. None of our new puppies have been formally trained, but many of our foster parents/adopters choose to crate train. It can be a great way to keep puppies safe and teach them independence. MEDICAL STATUS: Healthy as far as we know.

The only time she has issues with other dogs is when possessive over toys or food, so being the only dog in the household would be best. She’s getting better at walking on a leash and still pulls a little, but she's smart, food-motivated and trainable, so it's getting better. With treats she’ll happily follow along and try not to get distracted too much by squirrels, rabbits and scooters. Super food-driven and smart, she already knows a lot of commands like “sit, stay, down, roll, kiss, paw, leave it, come, play dead"". She loves giving her paw—sometimes without even being asked!

She is not food aggressive in any way. I don’t think she knows any commands but does understand the word no. Sadly she does not play with any toys! She doesn’t know what to do with them!

Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys.

She LOVES people and wants to say hi to everyone, gentle girl Comfortable with children? not sure, she’s not jumpy with it comes to people and wags her tail when walking past kids but so far no interaction Social with other dogs? needs some work, gets extremely excited and cries/jumps towards all dogs. I wouldn’t say unfriendly but needs to learn some manners. I think other dogs are unsure of her excitement. We need to have longer interactions so see how she is Respectful of other animals? she’s currently in a home with 3 cats. So far good but has a tendency to want to chase when they run fast. 1/10 times she will react towards them. Most of the down she just lays on the couch and ignores them.

Unfortunately, Bo's owner passed away, leading this beloved boy back into our care once again. Bo is an outgoing and friendly companion who adores being the center of attention. Bo loves to chew on stuffies and Kongs, sleeps peacefully through the night, and is always eager to curl up beside you on the couch. He doesn’t beg for people food, but will come barreling into the kitchen when any bag is open (smart boy!). We suspect Bo lived a pretty sheltered life; he doesn’t seem comfortable around the other dogs, and the busy city makes him anxious. But at our Center, he is a lovable, affectionate, easygoing guy. We have no doubts that he’ll flourish in any loving home outside the city. He's a very well-rounded dog. He is housetrained and walks well on leash, but can be reactive/overexcited when he sees other dogs. He loves car rides and will greet you with a toy and a wagging tail every time you come home. He's a very loyal, happy dog, and we cannot wait to see him in a loving home where he belongs. Please complete an application today to learn more about Bo. All dogs will be altered, microchipped, and receive age-appropriate vaccines prior to adoption.

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Their Foster Parent Says: ""When I say that Timmy had me falling absolutely head over heels in LOVE with him in less than 2 hours... He is an absolute delight and the MOST delicious little boy I've ever laid eyes on. He is gentle and sweet, curious and excited, and the most perfect blend of chill and fun. I truly don't know what more anyone could ask for. He's potty trained, sleeps through the night, doesn't bark, and hasn't chewed anything in my apartment (except his toys, as he should! He loves chewing toys). When he came to me, I was warned that he was timid and scared easily (which is true), but every day I have watched him challenge himself and become braver. I'm so proud of his progress. He will follow me around my apartment and offer up several kisses and hugs, which is wild because he was pretty terrified of kisses at first. (CUDDLE SHOULD BE HIS MIDDLE NAME THOUGH. He is the sweetest soul for anyone in search of a snuggly little bug.) At the same time, he will also initiate playtime with my 9 year old dog when he gets his zoomies and follow her lead on all our walks; it has been so sweet watching him look to her for guidance. It seems like she's helped him realize the world isn't such a scary place. With that being said, I would definitely recommend a home in a quieter neighborhood (and with a dog, if possible -- especially one that's not super timid, so he can continue to learn from them). For a dog that's so shy, he has been very quick to trust and love and make his way into my heart, so he is the most deserving of a home that will give him all that love right back. He enjoys exploring and sniffing everything on our daily walks (and we have even been able to increase his longer walk of the day to about 60-75 mins). Sometimes we pass a dog on the street that will give him some anxiety, so he may briefly growl a little bit, but otherwise, we can usually walk by them relatively easily. And it may be a challenge teaching him some basic commands like ""sit,"" because he gets a bit overwhelmed and backs up if you reach your arm out at him too quickly. So I'd recommend a family who can be gentle and patient with him for that stuff and who will be very present for him (because even though he's shy, he definitely LOVES his human(s)). All in all, I truly cannot say enough positive things about his behavior, personality, and stunning good looks. He's a charmer, and whoever adopts him is quite simply the luckiest."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. POTTY TRAINING - At this point, I don't even have pee pads out (I left them out the first couple days, but he never used them and he had no accidents). So I would definitely say he's potty trained! Yes – Few or no accidents COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS - He's definitely been shy around the few friends I've introduced him to, but he's not hiding or anything. He just tends to stay close to me (if we're in my apt, he'll come sit by me), or if we've been outside, he'll just sit in my lap or lean back into my arms). But he's not avoiding the new people altogether - he seems to be curious, and I'm sure with enough constant socialization he will open up with time. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) - Would be okay in a home with respectful teenagers and older. SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS - In my house, he's been nothing but amazing around my dog (and she's been gentle and kind to him, as well, which has been great!). He definitely looks up to her and looks to her for guidance and wants to be near her a lot, so I think he would do VERY well in a home with another dog(s) (I think it would be especially helpful for him so he can get out of his shell even more). On our walks, there have been a few bigger dogs that have gotten him nervous, but he did stop and give a dog a few kisses today! I was very impressed! SOCIAL WITH CATS? Yes. Almost all puppies have the potential to be friends with a cat. It’s on the adopter to know their cat’s temperament and preferences and to teach their puppy respectful manners. MOUTHY BEHAVIOR - On the rare occasion he will try to put my fingers in his mouth when we're cuddling (BUT it's not in a teething or trying to bite me type of way - it's always been very gentle and VERY brief). He hasn't really chewed anything major in my home that he isn't supposed to (he did pick up a coaster and nibbled on that for a minute, but that's about it). Past this stage– Little to no interest in chewing on stuff or putting things in their mouth that aren’t food. Doesn’t try to chew on hands, feet, etc. during playtime SEPARATION ANXIETY (Please leave your foster dog home alone every day for at least 20 minutes.)Adjusting – Might cry for a few minutes when you first leave the house but settles pretty quickly and has no problem being left alone otherwise. LEASH MANNERS - I would say he pulls a little at times or gets a bit scared by a noise and will abruptly stop walking or hop to a side or something. But all in all, I'd say he's pretty good on the leash and we're working on increasing the length of our walks. We've had a few that were 60-90 mins, and he has been loving them! Getting the hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in their life but figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. CUDDLE BUG LEVEL - I would say he is VERY snuggly and cuddly - I would say somewhere between medium and high depending on the day/time. We were initially having him sleep in his little bed on the ground next to my bed (where I sleep with my dog), and the past couple nights he's hopped up into my bed and slept with us there. He likes to come cuddle on the couch with me as well, but I also leave his bed on my couch during the day, so he'll cuddle up in there a lot as well. JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO - I think because of his shyness and being easily spooked, he hasn't yet explored jumping on people or dogs, but he does jump on me when I come home out of excitedness. For other people though, it's usually very calm! He definitely follows me around the house though! Calm Greetings – Doesn’t jump up on people or dogs. Always all four on the floor. CRATE TRAINING - I wasn't given a crate when I picked up Timmy, so we've been just going with it and letting him free in the apartment, even when I leave. So far, this has not been an issue How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee or St. Thomas. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

Meet Luke, a senior dog who has been waiting patiently for a quiet home to call his own. Luke is an incredibly sweet boy who truly aims to please. It's clear he hasn't had the easiest life, as he can be a bit head shy, but his capacity for forgiveness is immense. All he wants is a gentle hand and a person to dote on. To help Luke find the perfect retirement home, a generous anonymous donor has sponsored a portion of his adoption fee! (Luke's adoption fee is $150) We've made sure Luke is all set for his new beginning. He's had a full senior bloodwork panel and a recent dental cleaning (including x-rays and extractions). Like many seniors, he has some age-related aches and anxiety, but both are easily managed with affordable daily medication. He also has some ""Westie skin itchies,"" which are common and manageable. He's had great relief with a monthly injection and daily Benadryl. Luke's Ideal Home: He needs to be the only pet in the home. While he's friendly with other dogs on leash, he wants to be the king of his own castle and soak up all your attention. A calm, adult-only household is best. He needs a home without small children (now or in the future) to help him feel safe and secure. This wonderful, resilient boy has so much love left to give. Could you be the one to show him what a true forever home feels like? Vaccinated for rabies, DHPP, bordetella, and Lepto. Neutered and microchipped. Current on flea, tick, and heartworm prevention.

Chiquito is a 5-year-old, 22-pound male dachshund terrier mix from Alabama! Chiquito is a cuddly, cozy, loving pup looking for a place to nap and someone willing to throw a toy for him to chase. Chiquito has adjusted beautifully to life in Brooklyn, and is eager to go on walks in the neighborhood and meet as many neighborhood pups as possible. Chiquito lives to fetch and then curl up in a lap for a long nap. Chiquito is doing well understanding “sit” “wait” “shake” and working on other obedience training. During his time with his foster family, he seems to be house trained, and does a great job letting them know when it’s time to go outside by politely walking in circles by the door. He is good on a leash and still working on ignoring other dogs while out and about (he really reeeeally wants to make friends.) Chiquito's forever family will need to continue working with him to reinforce and advance the progress he’s been making with learning to commands and staying focused on leash. Chiquito has done well in his crate during the day - he may whimper a bit, but does a good job of self soothing and going to sleep after a few minutes. He loves to be cozy with his foster family and can often be found with his favorite meercat plushie. Chiquito is looking for a lowkey family that will take him out for walks and snuggle up with him nearby. He appreciates downtime and active moments, with a solid mix of cuddles and playtime during the day. He can keep himself occupied with a chew toy for hours, and loves to search for treats. He would do well as a solo dog or with other dogs in the house. We would recommend Chiquito go to a home with older children. Vaccinated for rabies, DHPP, and bordetella, neutered and microchipped.

Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Our Team Says: Loreen needs a home out of the city. She is NOT a city girl. Burbs and beyond are ideal for her. She would also do great with another dog in the home :) Our Foster Parent Says: "" Loreen is a very sweet girl who still has her puppy moments. She has zoomies, especially when you come home after work of if you were just gone for 2 minutes. She recently discovered her love of toys and gathers each one of them into her bed. Unfortunately she hasn’t quite figured out toy vs non-toy yet but she’s easily redirected. Her bed is her safe space, especially when she’s has her anxious moments. When Loreen initially came to NYC from Tennessee she was very scared being in a city setting and shook for an entire week. She was then relocated to Long Island with me and the quiet environment has really let her true self show. She has slowly warmed up to being outside and now runs around happily in my yard and is learning to enjoy walks. Having another confident dog is definitely a plus! She often looks to my dog Kiba when she gets nervous and even follows him around sometimes. At home she is a cuddle bug and loves to be near you. She politely asks for airlifts onto the bed but occasionally gives a sassy bark or two to get your attention. She does well with baths and brushing, she’s also happy to be dressed! She’s very good with both of my cats and my dog, she’s very neutral around everyone and does not show any signs of guarding issues. She did well around a 3 year old boy and generally does well with everyone, she is occasionally anxious with new people. Overall she is a go with the flow type of girl and follows her people around.""

Rescued from deplorable conditions at a gas station, he endured a life of neglect, tied up and surviving on coffee and food scraps. His life took a turn for the better when a compassionate resident, who had cared for him and another dog named Sleeping Beauty, stepped in to save them from an uncertain and bleak future.

His coat is a handsome blend of caramel and white, with soulful brown eyes that speak volumes of his resilience and longing for a loving home.

He's not a picky eater and enjoys a well-balanced diet. Bathing: While he may not particularly enjoy bath time, Prince Hans patiently stands still. He's a cooperative dog who understands that some things are part of the grooming routine. Treats and Walks: Prince Hans lights up when it's treat time or time for a leisurely walk. These are some of his favorite activities, and you'll see his excitement shine through during these moments. Otherwise, he's content to lounge quietly and relax. Training: Prince Hans already knows commands like ""Sit"" and ""Stay,"" which is a testament to his intelligence and eagerness to please. He's a quick learner and is ready to embark on further training adventures with his new family. Ideal Home: Prince Hans would thrive in a calm and loving home where he can continue to heal from his past experiences. He's a perfect fit for individuals or families seeking a loyal and low-energy companion who appreciates the simple pleasures in life. He would do well in a home with a secure yard for leisurely strolls and playtime. Adoption Notes: Prince Hans has come a long way from the gas station where he was found.

We're working to help her get desensitized to noises and she's making great progress. Dot allows us to hold her in our laps and stroke her but definitely prefers her crate. She loves walking outside and will voluntarily come out of the crate to be leashed. She also enjoys being taken on errands in her dog carrier and sticks her head out to see what's happening. In the park she sniffs the ground and is curious about other dogs -- she will approach them and allows herself to be sniffed without fear.

Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Thier Foster Parents Say: ""Drama doesn’t live up to her name in the best way. She’s brilliant, incredibly well behaved, pretty chill throughout the day, and loves to go for walks and play respectfully with our dog. She’s wonderful on a leash - it’s actually really impressive. She has been going to the bathroom outside and on pee pads inside. She has also let us know when she needs to get off of our couch or bed for a potty break. Drama is cuddly and affectionate, pretty independent and doesn’t mind resting by herself or hanging out with a toy or bully stick. She’s food motivated and a great listener - Drama will be an absolute joy to train. She responds to corrections and redirection extremely well. Whoever adopts Drama will be so lucky to have her. She has the best temperament and tons of potential - she is truly a rare find."" Level of dog ownership experience needed: INTERMEDIATE: As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day. The adopter must have relevant primary care experience with a similar breed, temperament, and/or energy level. (Primary care experience includes ownership, fostering, or dog sitting as an adult, not a dog you grew up with.) Relevant puppy care experience is a huge plus, but bare minimum the adopter must have TONS of time and patience. Raising a puppy can be a lot of fun, but it’s also tremendous work. Puppies’ personalities and exercise/stimulation requirements change dramatically between now and when they’re a year old as their bodies and brains develop, so an active lifestyle and the ability to adapt to a pup’s evolving needs are a must. We strongly urge professional dog training with a rewards based trainer from the get go. Adults only or kids ages 8 and up – all puppies go through a mouthy, rambunctious phase and often accidentally hurt children when playing. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN BREED RESEARCH to make sure you have a better understanding of the kind of temperament and exercise requirements this dog may have as an adult. Energy level MEDIUM: Very young puppies sleep and nap a lot, but their energy level skyrockets when they become teens (4 months to around a year). As an adult, this dog will need significant structure and plenty of daily exercise, training, and mental stimulation – 90 consecutive minutes of movement in the morning plus potty break walks and brain games throughout the day at a minimum. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) TOLERANCE TO CITY City pup – Seems unfazed by the sights and sounds, may as well have been born here. POTTY TRAINING Sort of -- On the way and learning! May be using wee pads (is a puppy or a brand new rescue) COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS Social butterfly – Wants to be friends with everyone who walks by, loves anyone who will stop to say hello. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Yes for most ages – very confident, gentle, low energy, tolerant, not mouthy SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Yes – Good with most other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc.) Not sure – Wants to chase squirrels and birds so may not be a good match for a home with cats, rabbits, etc. MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Past this stage– Little to no interest in chewing on stuff or putting things in their mouth that aren’t food. Doesn’t try to chew on hands, feet, etc. during playtime SEPARATION ANXIETY (Please leave your foster dog home alone every day for at least 20 minutes.) Past this stage – Completely fine being left home alone. Doesn’t cry or exhibit destructive behavior when you leave the apartment or house. LEASH MANNERS Getting the hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in their life but figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. CUDDLE BUG LEVEL Medium – Likes to snuggle when he's in the mood but often stays in his own bed JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Needs training – Very excited to greet everyone and has no idea how to do so politely. Jumps up on most strangers or other dogs that go by. In puppy phase or wasn’t trained as a young adult. CRATE TRAINING Working on it – We set one up and leave the door open but rarely close it because the dog freaks out *We haven’t used the crate much but are working on it. She’s a calm girl overall and not super needy, so I’m confident she will do fine. MEDICAL STATUS: Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP and Bordetella vaccines (for dogs under 4 months old, adopters will need to finish the DHPP vaccine series and administer the Rabies vaccine at 16 weeks of age), spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon HOW DID THIS DOG END UP WITH US? Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

My name is Chat and I am a little 6 year old retired breeding mama that was used to just make puppies my whole life. I am getting use to life inside a loving home and just learning my surroundings. I do not ask for much but for someone who can be patient and kind to me as I have not had that before. I am working on my potty training and doing very well, just a few accidents here and there, but my foster mommy said that's normal. I feel more comfortable with dogs than humans as they have not treated me the best. I do not ever growl or show aggression, however sudden movements, loud noises, and being in unfamiliar places or people gets me anxious and causes me to shake. I definitely am a suburbs kind of girl and would do best in a quite home to help me flourish , loud noises or alarms can be very scary for me. As of right now I am definitely SMALL dog friendly, bigger dogs can be scary to me as I am a small girl. I probably wouldn't mind cats but not tested with them as of yet (soon to come though) I also have not been tested with children yet as my foster mommy is helping me decompress (will be introduced soon to confirm) However, she thinks I would do best in a home with older children, who can understand my needs and understand to give me time to come out of my shell and understand my shyness. My foster mommy thinks I am mixed with another breed of some sort, my hair is straight, doesn't seem to shed, and my hair dries super quick after my baths! I am quite calm and good for people who don't care about too much physical activity outside my potty walks. I like to lay in the grass and in the shade breathing in the fresh air, giving a few snorts here and there. I am doing a great job learning to potty outside, a quick 5-10 minute walk is all I need, right now getting walked 4x a day. I do not pull and quite easy to walk, but make sure you hold onto my leash in case I get scared. I adore my food very much and that is what I've been most excited about other than meeting other doggie friends. Unfortunately I have not had treats yet but that will hopefully change soon because they smell really tasty but I haven't been motivated to eat them yet, although offered. My foster doggie name in the house is what my original name was, Oreo (I respond best to that) ! I can't wait to meet you and find a great loving forever home that I deserved from the start !

Opera is a gentle, about one-year-old mixed-breed pup (very likely with some AmStaff in her), and she is looking for a patient, loving home where she can finally feel safe. Opera has been through more than any dog should. She was found with a severe injury to her neck and brought to a county shelter in Tifton, Georgia, where she got surgery to heal. She is 100% better health wise, but the emotional scars still remain. She arrived scared, shut down, and unsure of the world — but every day she shows us that she wants to trust. With quiet routines, kindness, and a calm environment, she is already making small, meaningful steps forward. Opera has not shown an ounce of agressivesness. Her instinct is to freeze when she is unsure or scared. She loves her food, responds beautifully to a soft voice, and finds comfort in having a cozy spot of her own. Once she feels secure, her sweet personality shines through. Opera will absolutely blossom with someone willing to give her time, consistency, and reassurance. If you’ve ever wanted to witness a transformation — to help a fearful dog discover joy, play, and confidence — Opera is your girl.

I currently live in the East Village and while I'm a better walker on a quiet street, I love a late night walk before bed around a busy street because that means I get more attention. The only time I bark is when I hear the doorbell or if there is something spooky in the street, but each time I bark, my foster mom is a bit confused because I usually am a pretty quiet pup. I would prefer having a yard, but I've been good in an apartment because I get to go on a lot of walks.

Meet Kloe: The Chill Queen with a Heart of Gold (and a Nose Boop to Prove It) If you're looking for a dog who can handle the chaos of life with grace and a dash of humor, look no further than Kloe. Tantruming toddlers? She offers a comforting nose boop, then gracefully removes herself from the drama like the mature queen she is, even at the young age of two years old. Kloe is the gold standard of gentle play—excited zoomies with adults, four-on-the-floor patience with kids, and not a single snatchy move in sight. She takes treats like a lady, has no interest in guarding resources, and frankly doesn’t even notice if someone strolls past her food. (We don’t recommend toddler taste-testing her kibble, but you get the vibe.) Her nighttime routine? Legendary. She potty breaks at 6pm and calls it a day. Even if you beg her from the backyard in your PJs, she’ll be upstairs in bed like, “Nah, I’m good.” She sleeps through the night like a champ and waits patiently for you to rise, whether it's 6am or a lazy Sunday 8am. Car rides? Loves them. Visitors? Welcomes them. Delivery people? Whatever. Kloe is unfazed by the world’s noise and just wants to vibe, cuddle, and be your loyal sidekick. One thing to know: Kloe prefers her personal space when it comes to other dogs. She’s not the dog park type, and that’s okay—she’d much rather be your one-and-only. With people, she’s a total lovebug; with other pups, she appreciates a little distance and respectful boundaries. Think of her as the introvert who loves her humans but doesn't feel the need to mingle with the whole dog block. She’s the full package: calm, kind, gentle, hilarious, house-trained, and delightfully opinionated about bedtime. Come meet the girl who’s got it all—Kloe’s ready to boop her way into your heart. 🌟 In the home: Extremely chill and well-mannered — not a jumper Total cuddlebug and wants to be snuggled up next to you — and any visitors — at all times Loves toys and playtime Potty trained and will stand by the door when she needs to go out Doesn’t chew furniture — or anything but squeaky toys :) Not mouthy — no play biting Loves lounging on the floor and only hops on the couch when invited Doesn’t beg for food — minds her own business during meals Loves to play fetch and has a special affinity for hoses :) Crate trained Patient & loving with toddler foster sister 🌟 On leash: Very treat-motivated and easy to redirect with a tasty snack We are still working on leash manners, but Kloe improves every day!

Don't let his age fool you—Sunny is a spry guy with pep in his step! He loves walks, adores his humans, and is friendly with other dogs and cats. Sunny's Wish List: A patient, understanding human who can give him stability. A quiet, structured home where he can be the king of his own castle.

He just needs time, patience, and a predictable routine to help him settle and feel safe. This is your chance to give a deserving senior the one thing he wants: a stable, loving home to keep him comfortable for all his days. He is so deserving. The love you'll get back from this magical creature will be tenfold. Can you be Sunny's safe landing? Vaccinated for rabies, DHPP, and bordetella, heartworm negative, and microchipped.

Nala is a mellow, easygoing mama who recently arrived in NYC after raising a litter of pups. She’s still decompressing and adjusting to city life, but every day she’s becoming more trusting, more curious—and more ready for her next chapter. A little shy and scared at first, Nala finds her greatest joy outside with her doggy friends. She absolutely loves being around other pups—they help her feel safe and confident. (A home with a friendly resident dog would be a big plus!) She’s also cool with cats and seems comfortable around kids, though she hasn’t had much direct interaction just yet. Indoors, Nala is a quiet observer. She’s crate-trained, house-trained, and low-shedding. She is easy on her own at home, communicates when she needs to go out and walks beautifully on leash—calm, close, and with no pulling. She’s not a barker and has shown zero signs of aggression. Most of the day, she’s content to snooze in her crate or quietly explore a little more of her space. Her favorite hobby? Chillin’ 💤 Navigating the building lobby and elevator still makes her a bit nervous, but with gentle encouragement, she’s learning to get more comfortable and build trust in her surroundings. Nala is currently on heartworm medication and otherwise doing great—eating well, resting lots, and slowly blooming into the relaxed, loving companion we know she’s meant to be. She would thrive in a calm, loving home—especially one with other dogs—and with someone who’s happy to let her open up on her own terms. Ready to fall in love? Nala is waiting. 💕 Personality & Characteristics: Very calm and happy to be resting, happiest outside and around other dog friends My foster dog is good with: Loves being around other dogs, good with cats, seems good with kids but haven't had the opportunity for much interaction with kids yet (expect she would be fine!)

This beautiful boy was shot in the mouth while a drug warrant was being served; fortunately, the bullet lodged in Beau's neck in a spot that is not causing any pain or limitation. It was determined that it's best left there as the surgery to remove it is dangerous. Beau is a couch potato and LOVES to cuddle, is completely housebroken, enjoys car rides and does not chew or destroy anything (except for his toys which he loves to remove squeakers from). Beau would be perfect for a person or couple that doesn’t have other animals or has one submissive female (the only type of dogs he seems to get along with). He needs to be the center of attention so he can get all the love and attention he deserves. Beau is reactive to other dogs, so walking can be a bit challenging (he has a loud bark).

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application a t socialteesnyc.org Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. Energy level MEDIUM: Needs a daily 60 minute walk or window of quick paced exercise (minimum) in addition to potty break strolls (10-30 min each). Also needs significant socializing opportunities outside the home and mental stimulation at home like tricks training practice, chew items, and puzzle toys. (This is regardless of dog size – many small breeds were designed for lots of activity and will exhibit unwanted behavior when they’re understimulated.) Okay in the city? We don’t know yet. Most adult dogs do well in the city after they’ve had time to adjust to a new environment, but some never adapt and need homes in the burbs. Potty trained? Probably! Adults usually are, but all will have transitional accidents for the first week or so. A consistent walking route and schedule plus finding spots with grass or dirt can help. Social with other dogs? Yes, but we don’t know to what degree yet. Some like to wrestle with every passing pup, others can coexist well but prefer to keep to themselves. We’ll learn more soon. Social with cats? Not sure yet! Some breed mixes that are generally NOT great matches for homes with cats include large hounds, huskies, and shepherds. Comfortable with children? (ALWAYS requires adult supervision) We’re not sure yet, but we try to err on the side of caution. Respectful kids ages 8 and up are probably a safe bet. Children must always be monitored and taught to interact with dogs of any age respectfully. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm tested if coming from the South or Puerto Rico ; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Los Angeles and Puerto Rico. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though!

I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Tourmaline, or Tourmie for short. As many of us know (and for those who may not be aware), Tourmaline is the name of a popular gemstone that comes in many colors, and my particular color is brown. Not to brag, but when people first meet me, they always think I’m a young lady, but to tell the truth, I’m over 10 years old. It could be that I try to stay in shape (I love long walks and even short runs!). Since it’s not polite to ask a lady’s weight, I’ll tell you that I weigh about 50 pounds. It could be that as much as I like to just cuddle, have my tummy scratched, and generally just be loved (and give it back 10fold). Speaking of walks, I’m great on a leash. I sometimes do pull a little bit. I get a bit excited when I see other dogs being walked, but they're typically more interested in me than I am in them, so I'll just pass them by. I'm great with ALL humans, even kids! The only thing I’m not really fond of is being left by myself. I don’t make a mess, but I usually spend a couple of minutes calling out your name or asking you not to leave me alone. Of course, because we don’t speak the same language, to you, it just sounds like I’m barking. Otherwise, I’m very easygoing, especially when I’m snuggling, and I’m totally housebroken. I’ll sit when I’m told to and stay when I’m told. I don’t really like to play tug of war, but I've warmed up to ""fetch"". I do like to make sure my human is doing OK, so I sometimes follow him/her to whatever room they’re in if I notice they’re gone. This might be because I was abandoned. I don’t really remember how I was treated before I was found, so it could also be from then. I love the little treats my current human brings with us on walks. They also use them to help teach me new commands when we get back from walks. I'm even allowed to sleep on the bed overnight. The bottom line is that I’m just a bundle of love looking for someone to love and be loved by!",Adult,https://www.wagtopia.com/search/pet?id=2502562,True,49.0,Medium,Unknown,True,True,Not Sure

Holly is a 60-pound cuddle bug in a tiny, low-rider package; more baby hippo than dog! She's got a big smushy head and even bigger ears, the perfect recipe to melt your heart. She’s a happy little soul who's sees the world as a place full of new friends and good snacks. Loud unfamiliar noises and environments can sometimes make her feel nervous. But if you let her go at her own pace and give her some reassurance, you'll see the silly, snuggly and playful dog she truly is. A little over 2 years old, Holly is as gentle as they come. Whether it's taking a treat or playing tug, she knows her stength and is very careful with it. She adores her toys and loves her people, so it’s no surprise that her favorite time of day is when she gets to enjoy both at once! While she can pull on the leash, she’s shown no reactivity towards dogs or the busy nyc streets. She is still polishing up on her leash manners — mostly because she’s so thrilled to be out exploring. But with positive reinforcement, she’s learning very quickly to walk by our side. Holly hasn’t met a person she doesn’t instantly adore. She’s a pro sleeper, pro cuddler, and gives the sweetest kisses. She’s fully potty trained and tells us exactly when she needs to go out — proof she’s mastered home life in no time. Holly came to the ACC as a scared stray and then spent weeks in a tiny pop-up crate. Now that she knows she's safe, her crate is a cozy, safe place and she'd be happy to snooze there while you're out. We’re not sure if Holly has had doggie siblings before, but with a slow introduction she’s done great with her four legged foster cousin in the suburbs! She’s a sweet, affectionate girl who gets very excited when meeting new friends — both two- and four-legged! She knows her basic commands like ""sit"", ""paw"" and ""wait"" but she's such a smart girl we're sure she'll learn anything you want to teach her. Like any true new yorker, she's an avid subway goer and has been the star of the show at every patio happy hour! We've also discovered that she absolutely loves bath time. She sits so patiently, soaking up all the scrubs and affection like a little spa queen. Friends of Holly say she's the ""cutest, sweetest, happiest and wiggliest little hippo you will ever meet!""

I also do not pull on the leash at all ALL adoptions require a completed application and final contract.

A soft-hearted sweetheart looking for her forever cuddle buddies. At 6 years old and 54 lbs, Patron is a true pocket-sized girl that often gets mistaken for a puppy. This beautiful mixed-breed girl is calm, quiet, and completely content to go at her own pace. She spent the first six years of her life in one home, so she’s now adjusting to big changes and is looking for a stable, loving forever family to help her feel safe again. Patron is an independent queen with a soft side. She may take a little time to warm up, but once she trusts you, she becomes incredibly loyal. She’s not overly clingy but will never turn down a chance to rest her head on your lap and soak up all of the scratches and cuddles. At home, she’s a total angel happy to snooze in her crate, relax on the couch, or hang nearby while you work. She’s house-trained, crate-trained, and fully okay being alone if you need to head out for a bit (and will be excited to run up to greet you when you get home!) Patron is super easygoing overall. She matches your schedule: want to sleep in? She’ll sleep in. Early riser? She’s with you. She’s the kind of pup that just wants to be your quiet companion through whatever the day brings. Patron would do best as the only dog in the home. Her relationship to other dogs seems to be based in curiousity and timidness versus aggression, but she will need some patience and support as she becomes more comfortable and confident around other dogs. Out on walks, she gets excited and pulls toward other dogs but with a bit of patience and structure, she’ll keep improving her leash manners. Patron is looking for someone with a gentle heart and a bit of patience, someone who will give her the space to bloom. And when she does, you’ll have the sweetest, most soulful dog by your side. She’s calm. She’s loyal. And she’s ready for her forever.",Adult,https://www.wagtopia.com/search/pet?id=2457654,True,54.0,Medium,Unknown,True,True,Not Sure

Please email fostertoadopt@socialteesnyc.org with the animal’s name in the subject line if you are interested! Want to straight up adopt? Submit an adoption application at socialteesnyc.org. Thier Foster Parent Says: "" Apple is the sweetest and most lovable girl! She’s an incredibly gentle and well-behaved pup with a curious spirit. Most of the time, she’s calm and cozy.. a true snuggle bug who could spend hours cuddling and soaking up belly rubs (her all-time favorite activity!). When she gets a burst of energy, she loves playing with her squeaky toys, throwing them up in the air, and showing off her playful side. On walks, she tends to get the attention of passerby’s with her adorable face and frequent head tilts. She’s a wonderful apartment dog who is respectful, mostly quiet, and happiest when she’s close to her people. She’s also getting into a good potty routine, typically going in the morning and improving every day as she adjusts to her schedule. She even enjoys her paws being cleaned with her doggy wipes when she gets back into the apartment (she treats it like she’s at the spa!). Apple is the perfect mix of affectionate, mellow, and curious, and will make an awesome companion in her forever home!"" Level of dog ownership experience needed: BEGINNER: This means we predict this dog will be low on the challenge scale due to its breed/age combo. Potentially a good fit for someone who has relevant dog care experience (fostering, dog sitting) and is looking to adopt their first pup. TOLERANCE TO CITY City pup – Seems unfazed by the sights and sounds, may as well have been born here. POTTY TRAINING Yes – Few or no accidents COMFORT LEVEL WITH STRANGERS In between bean – Fine with meeting new people but not particularly interested, kind of shy in busy social situations like a gathering or a packed day in the park. BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN (always requires adult supervision) Yes for most ages – very confident, gentle, low energy, tolerant, not mouthy SOCIAL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER DOGS Yes – Good with most other dogs (sizes, breeds, etc.) as far as we know and enjoys socializing with other canines *** she will pull towards some other dogs because she wants to say hi but is very easy to redirect and keep walking. She can also be unfazed as well. We have only allowed her to socialize in very quick on-the-go interactions but seems good with other dogs. Used to live with other dogs - okay to be in a home with another dog :) RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOR WITH OTHER ANIMALS (cats, small pets, etc.) Okay to be in a home with cats - we don't forsee this being an issue and she came from a home with cats MOUTHY BEHAVIOR Past this stage– Little to no interest in chewing on stuff or putting things in their mouth that aren’t food. Doesn’t try to chew on hands, feet, etc. during playtime SEPARATION ANXIETY (Please leave your foster dog home alone every day for at least 20 minutes.) Past this stage – Completely fine being left home alone. Doesn’t cry or exhibit destructive behavior when you leave the apartment or house. LEASH MANNERS Getting the hang of it – Probably hasn’t been on a leash much in their life but figuring it out. Might be a mild puller but responds to correction. CUDDLE BUG LEVEL High – Wants to be in your lap pretty much all the time JUMPING ON PEOPLE TO SAY HELLO Calm Greetings – Doesn’t jump up on people or dogs. Always all four on the floor. CRATE TRAINING Yep/mostly – Seems comfortable in the crate, may whine a little at first but settles pretty quickly. We use the crate when we leave the pup alone and/or at night. *** we left her in the crate when we were at work for the first few days and she would walk into it when we pointed at it without using any words. She seems to be used to it and falls asleep but she is very good so we don’t put her in the crate anymore. She sleeps in her dog bed in our room at night, not in the crate. Medical status Healthy as far as we know. Recovering from an ear infection - common for the breed mix. Up to date on their DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies vaccines; heartworm negative; spayed/neutered; microchipped; treated with dewormer upon intake How this dog ended up with Social Tees: Most of our dogs come via partner groups who help us save them from shelters where they are at risk of euthanasia in Tennessee, Puerto Rico or Southern California. There are very few spay/neuter resources there and many more animals in those areas than there are people to adopt them. Rescue groups like ours bring them to the northeast where the desire for pets like these allows us to save their lives. PLEASE NOTE: We cannot guarantee any breed mix, exact age, or full grown size (if the dog is under a year old). We do our best with very educated guesses though! This animal is not at the Social Tees office, all are in foster homes.

Ion,Mixed Breed,Male,https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/petstablished-app-beta/uploads/image/image/5211514/FosterDogs-127.jpg,https://petstablished.com/public/search/redirect?application_type=adoption&pet_id=2368098&premium=true,"He LOVES other people (kids too!) and other dogs. He is curious about cats but hasn’t had much experience with them. He is crate trained, potty trained, knows most commands (sit, lie down, paw, is working on stay), is very food motivated and smart so is super trainable, sleeps through the night, loves playing tug, and loves belly runs. He’ll bring you a shoe as a gift when you arrive home and will play tug with it if you try to take it from him but doesn’t chew or destroy people-objects (just his toys and bones). He eventually just puts the shoe down (or will drop it for a treat!). He’s a cuddly sweet guy! He is pretty mellow during the day but likes a romp in the morning and evening. He is very social and seeks engagement so a home with multiple adults/children and with some greenspace (even a small yard) would be ideal. He is ok in the city, a bit scared of the loud noises and overhead trains, but otherwise fine. He is quite the food scavenger! I think he’d thrive best in the suburbs or upstate. He’s still working on his leash skills—can vacillate between pulling and being a bit resistant but is trainable. He’s also still working on recall and consistently responding to his name. He has a bit of resource guarding around bed and can be a bit jumpy if he’s woken up, so I recommend he not sleep in human’s bed (he sleeps in his crate with the door open) and couch cuddles only once you’ve grown familiar with one another. He loves smelling things and is endless curious about nature. Personality & Characteristics: The Ultimate Cuddle Bug & People Pleaser: Ion is simply the most snuggly and friendly pup you'll ever meet! The moment you sit down, he'll be right there, laying on your lap and gazing at you with the most loving eyes. He adores leaning on people and will even sit on your feet for extra closeness. Whip-Smart & A Training Superstar: We're not exaggerating – Ion is incredibly smart and genuinely the easiest dog to train ever! He's picked up a remarkable number of commands in just a few days, including sit, stay, lay, come, look at me, bed, crate, spin, leave it, paw, and even ""follow"" (he'll politely wait for you to go through doors first!). His food motivation makes learning a breeze! Perfectly Sized Companion: Everyone who meets Ion comments on his ideal size, making him a great fit for various living situations. Energy Matcher Extraordinaire: Ion is a true chameleon when it comes to energy! If you're feeling playful or a little anxious, he'll be ready to join in the fun. But if you're in a calm mood, he's just as happy to roll over for some delightful belly scratches. Quiet & Content: In our apartment, Ion is quite calm, usually a 3-4 on the energy scale, spending most of his day napping, with short bursts of playtime like tug-of-war. He's generally a quiet pup, only barking when it's time for a meal! House Trained & Crate Comfortable: Ion is fully house-trained and crate-trained. He sleeps soundly in his crate by himself. While he's still perfecting being left home alone (he might whine a bit initially but settles quickly), he's always calm and happy upon our return. Food Motivated: Loves treats, which are great for training and managing his mild separation anxiety. Sunbathing & Snuggles: His favorite things include soaking up the sun and getting lots of cuddles. Loves Kids: This sweet pup absolutely adores children and is always eager to say hello! Good with Dogs (with a caveat): He's successfully lived with four other dogs and isn't reactive on walks. However, he's a bit selective with his canine companions and may do best as the only dog or with a calm, tolerant buddy after a slow introduction. Low to Medium Shed: Easy to keep clean, with less shedding in cooler weather. Dream Home: Ion will thrive with a family who can shower him with cuddles and continue to reinforce his already impressive training with gentle reminders as he settles in. See More of Ion!

A true underdog, he had double cherry eye, a black coat, and a “bigger” dog. After putting in the work to be the bestest boy he can be, Benito is finally ready for his big debut. Over the many weeks with his foster, they’ve worked together on invaluable skills and he’s taken to them like a natural. Benito has shown us his spunky and social personality - he’s a lover of fetch, friendly with people, and now able to coexist with dogs his size. Benito would make an excellent addition in an adult only home as a solo pet. The perfect family lifestyle would be an active one filled with walks, hikes, playing fetch, and guardians willing to continue with his training. Daily socialization with dogs that match him well would be integral to reinforce his amazing progress. Another example of “it takes a village,” we cannot thank the fosters that have helped him reach this milestone in his journey. This happy, healthy, glowing young pup is ready for his second chance! If you’re interested in fostering or adopting, reach out to us or submit an application via the link in our bio.

His floof of a coat blows in the wind like a real life Fabio and his body still has the floppiness of a puppy. During one of our spay and neuter clinics at our facility in Bundang, a local shelter brought Sun in to get neutered. As soon as our rescue manager saw him, she insisted we take him and help his journey. With personal experience with the breed, she knew how lovely this uncommon pup was, and how low his chance of adoption would be with his size. Now in foster care, Sun is continuing to find himself and grow in many ways. On walks, he is beauty and grace and captivates the attention of many as he holds his nose up to the wind. He’s getting better at his leash walking manners by the day; though he is easily distracted, his quick-to-learn nature is helping him learn that engagement is key! Inside, he’s a walking and breathing shag rug, often sprawled out on the bare floors and splooting in good form. He enjoys chewing and playing with toys, sniffing anything he can get his nose on, and more than anything taking a good nap. Sun is looking for an adult-only household , ideally outside of Manhattan , where he can continue to thrive and grow.
